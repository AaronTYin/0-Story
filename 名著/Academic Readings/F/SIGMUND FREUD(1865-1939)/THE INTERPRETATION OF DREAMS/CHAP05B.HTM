<H3>
B. Infantile Experiences as the Source of Dreams</H3>
As the third of the peculiarities of the dream-content, we have adduced
the fact, in agreement with all other writers on the subject (excepting
Robert), that impressions from our childhood may appear in dreams, which
do not seem to be at the disposal of the waking memory. It is, of course,
difficult to decide how seldom or how frequently this occurs, because after
waking the origin of the respective elements of the dream is not recognized.
The proof that we are dealing with impressions of our childhood must thus
be adduced objectively, and only in rare instances do the conditions favour
such proof. The story is told by A. Maury, as being particularly conclusive,
of a man who decides to visit his birthplace after an absence of twenty
years. On the night before his departure he dreams that he is in a totally
unfamiliar locality, and that he there meets a strange man with whom he
holds a conversation. Subsequently, upon his return home, he is able to
convince himself that this strange locality really exists in the vicinity
of his home, and the strange man in the dream turns out to be a friend
of his dead father's, who is living in the town. This is, of course, a
conclusive proof that in his childhood he had seen both the man and the
locality. The dream, moreover, is to be interpreted as a dream of impatience,
like the dream of the girl who carries in her pocket the ticket for a concert,
the dream of the child whose father had promised him an excursion to the
Hameau (ch. III), and so forth. The motives which reproduce just these
impressions of childhood for the dreamer cannot, of course, be discovered
without analysis.

<P>&nbsp;One of my colleagues, who attended my lectures, and who boasted
that his dreams were very rarely subject to distortion, told me that he
had sometime previously seen, in a dream, his former tutor in bed with
his nurse, who had remained in the household until his eleventh year. The
actual location of this scene was realized even in the dream. As he was
greatly interested, he related the dream to his elder brother, who laughingly
confirmed its reality. The brother said that he remembered the affair very
distinctly, for he was six years old at the time. The lovers were in the
habit of making him, the elder boy, drunk with beer whenever circumstances
were favourable to their nocturnal intercourse. The younger child, our
dreamer, at that time three years of age, slept in the same room as the
nurse, but was not regarded as an obstacle.

<P>&nbsp;In yet another case it may be definitely established, without
the aid of dream-interpretation, that the dream contains elements from
childhood- namely, if the dream is a so-called perennial dream, one which,
being first dreamt in childhood, recurs again and again in adult years.
I may add a few examples of this sort to those already known, although
I have no personal knowledge of perennial dreams. A physician, in his thirties,
tells me that a yellow lion, concerning which he is able to give the precisest
information, has often appeared in his dream-life, from his earliest childhood
up to the present day. This lion, known to him from his dreams, was one
day discovered in natura, as a longforgotten china animal. The young man
then learned from his mother that the lion had been his favourite toy in
early childhood, a fact which he himself could no longer remember.

<P>&nbsp;If we now turn from the manifest dream-content to the dreamthoughts
which are revealed only on analysis, the experiences of childhood may be
found to recur even in dreams whose content would not have led us to suspect
anything of the sort. I owe a particularly delightful and instructive example
of such a dream

<P>to my esteemed colleague of the "yellow lion." After reading Nansen's
account of his polar expedition, he dreamt that he was giving the intrepid
explorer electrical treatment on an ice-floe for the sciatica of which
the latter complained! During the analysis of this dream he remembered
an incident of his childhood, without which the dream would be wholly unintelligible.
When he was three or four years of age he was one day listening attentively
to the conversation of his elders; they were talking of exploration, and
he presently asked his father whether exploration was a bad illness. He
had apparently confounded Reisen (journey, trips) with Reissen (gripes,
tearing pains), and the derision of his brothers and sisters prevented
his ever forgetting the humiliating experience.

<P>&nbsp;We have a precisely similar case when, in the analysis of the
dream of the monograph on the genus cyclamen, I stumble upon a memory,
retained from childhood, to the effect that when I was five years old my
father allowed me to destroy a book embellished with coloured plates. It
will perhaps be doubted whether this recollection really entered into the
composition of the dream content, and it may be suggested that the connection
was established subsequently by the analysis. But the abundance and intricacy
of the associative connections vouch for the truth of my explanation: cyclamen-
favourite flower- favourite dish- artichoke; to pick to pieces like an
artichoke, leaf by leaf (a phrase which at that time one heard daily, a
propos of the dividing up of the Chinese empire); herbarium- bookworm,
whose favourite food is books. I can further assure the reader that the
ultimate meaning of the dream, which I have not given here, is most intimately
connected with the content of the scene of childish destruction.

<P>&nbsp;In another series of dreams we learn from analysis that the very
wish which has given rise to the dream, and whose fulfilment the dream
proves to be, has itself originated in childhood, so that one is astonished
to find that the child with all his impulses survives in the dream.

<P>&nbsp;I shall now continue the interpretation of a dream which has already
proved instructive: I refer to the dream in which my friend R is my uncle.
We have carried its interpretation far enough for the wish-motive- the
wish to be appointed professor- to assert itself palpably; and we have
explained the affection felt for my friend R in the dream as the outcome
of opposition to, and defiance of, the two colleagues who appear in the
dreamthoughts. Thee dream was my own; I may, therefore, continue the analysis
by stating that I did not feel quite satisfied with the solution arrived
at. I knew that my opinion of these colleagues. who were so badly treated
in my dream-thoughts, would have been expressed in very different language
in my waking life; the intensity of the wish that I might not share their
fate as regards the appointment seemed to me too slight fully to account
for the discrepancy between my dream- opinion and my waking opinion. If
the desire to be addressed by another title were really so intense, it
would be proof of a morbid ambition, which I do not think I cherish, and
which I believe I was far from entertaining. I do not know how others who
think they know me would judge me; perhaps I really was ambitious; but
if I was, my ambition has long since been transferred to objects other
than the rank and title of Professor extraordinarius.

<P>&nbsp;Whence, then, the ambition which the dream has ascribed to me?
Here I am reminded of a story which I heard often in my childhood, that
at my birth an old peasant woman had prophesied to my happy mother (whose
first-born I was) that she had brought a great man into the world. Such
prophecies must be made very

<P>frequently; there are so many happy and expectant mothers, and so many
old peasant women, and other old women who, since their mundane powers
have deserted them, turn their eyes toward the future; and the prophetess
is not likely to suffer for her prophecies. Is it possible that my thirst
for greatness has originated from this source? But here I recollect an
impression from the later years of my childhood, which might serve even
better as an explanation. One evening, at a restaurant on the Prater, where
my parents were accustomed to take me when I was eleven or twelve years
of age, we noticed a man who was going from table to table and, for a small
sum, improvising verses upon any subject that was given him. I was sent
to bring the poet to our table, and he showed his gratitude. Before asking
for a subject he threw off a few rhymes about myself, and told us that
if he could trust his inspiration I should probably one day become a minister.
I can still distinctly remember the impression produced by this second
prophecy. It was in the days of the "bourgeois Ministry"; my father had
recently brought home the portraits of the bourgeois university graduates,
Herbst, Giskra, Unger, Berger and others, and we illuminated the house
in their honour. There were even Jews among them; so that every diligent
Jewish schoolboy carried a ministerial portfolio in his satchel. The impression
of that time must be responsible for the fact that until shortly before
I went to the university I wanted to study jurisprudence, and changed my
mind only at the last moment. A medical man has no chance of becoming a
minister. And now for my dream: It is only now that I begin to see that
it translates me from the sombre present to the hopeful days of the bourgeois
Ministry, and completely fulfils what was then my youthful ambition. In
treating my two estimable and learned colleagues, merely because they are
Jews, so badly, one as though he were a simpleton and the other as though
he were a criminal, I am acting as though I were the Minister; I have put
myself in his place. What a revenge I take upon his Excellency! He refuses
to appoint me Professor extraordinarius, and so in my dream I put myself
in his place.

<P>&nbsp;In another case I note the fact that although the wish that excites
the dream is a contemporary wish it is nevertheless greatly reinforced
by memories of childhood. I refer to a series of dreams which are based
on the longing to go to Rome. For a long time to come I shall probably
have to satisfy this longing by means of dreams, since, at the season of
the year when I should be able to travel, Rome is to be avoided for reasons
of health. * Thus I once dreamt that I saw the Tiber and the bridge of
Sant' Angelo from the window of a railway carriage; presently the train
started, and I realized that I had never entered the city at all. The view
that appeared in the dream was modelled after a well-known engraving which
I had casually noticed the day before in the drawing-room of one of my
patients. In another dream someone took me up a hill and showed me Rome
half shrouded in mist, and so distant that I was astonished at the distinctness
of the view. The content of this dream is too rich to be fully reported
here. The motive, "to see the promised land afar," is here easily recognizable.
The city which I thus saw in the mist is Lubeck; the original of the hill
is the Gleichenberg. In a third dream I am at last in Rome. To my disappointment
the scenery is anything but urban: it consists of a little stream of black
water, on one side of which are black rocks, while on the other are meadows
with large white flowers. I notice a certain Herr Zucker (with whom I am
superficially acquainted), and resolve to ask him to show me the way into
the city. It is obvious that I am trying in vain to see in my dream a city
which I have never seen in my waking life. If I resolve the landscape into
its elements, the white flowers point to Ravenna, which is known to me,
and which once, for a time, replaced Rome as the capital of Italy. In the
marshes around Ravenna we had found the most beautiful water-lilies in
the midst of black pools of water; the dream makes them grow in the meadows,
like the narcissi of our own Aussee, because we found it so troublesome
to cull them from the water. The black rock so close to the water vividly
recalls the valley of the Tepl at Karlsbad. Karlsbad now enables me to
account for the peculiar circumstance that I ask Herr Zucker to show me
the way. In the material of which the dream is woven I am able to recognize
two of those amusing Jewish anecdotes which conceal such profound and,
at times, such bitter worldly wisdom, and which we are so fond of quoting
in our letters and conversation. One is the story of the constitution;
it tells how a poor Jew sneaks into the Karlsbad express without a ticket;
how he is detected, and is treated more and more harshly by the conductor
at each succeeding call for tickets; and how, when a friend whom he meets
at one of the stations during his miserable journey asks him where he is
going, he answers: "To Karlsbad- if my constitution holds out." Associated
in memory with this is another story about a Jew who is ignorant of French,
and who has express instructions to ask in Paris for the Rue Richelieu.
Paris was for many years the goal of my own longing, and I regarded the
satisfaction with which I first set foot on the pavements of Paris as a
warrant that I should attain to the fulfilment of other wishes also. Moreover,
asking the way is a direct allusion to Rome, for, as we know, "all roads
lead to Rome." And further, the name Zucker (sugar) again points to Karlsbad,
whither we send persons afflicted with the constitutional disease, diabetes
(Zuckerkrankheit, sugardisease.) The occasion for this dream was the proposal
of my Berlin friend that we should meet in Prague at Easter. A further
association with sugar and diabetes might be found in the matters which
I had to discuss with him. -

<P>&nbsp;* I long ago learned that the fulfilment of such wishes only called
for a little courage, and I then became a zealous pilgrim to Rome. -

<P>A fourth dream, occurring shortly after the last-mentioned, brings me
back to Rome. I see a street corner before me, and am astonished that so
many German placards should be posted there. On the previous day, when
writing to my friend, I had told him, with truly prophetic vision, that
Prague would probably not be a comfortable place for German travellers.
The dream, therefore, expressed simultaneously the wish to meet him in
Rome instead of in the Bohemian capital, and the desire, which probably
originated during my student days, that the German language might be accorded
more tolerance in Prague. As a matter of fact, I must have understood the
Czech language in the first years of my childhood, for I was born in a
small village in Moravia, amidst a Slay population. A Czech nursery rhyme,
which I heard in my seventeenth year, became, without effort on my part,
so imprinted upon my memory that I can repeat it to this day, although
I have no idea of its meaning. Thus in these dreams also there is no lack
of manifold relations to the impressions of my early childhood.

<P>&nbsp;During my last Italian journey, which took me past Lake Trasimenus,
I at length discovered, after I had seen the Tiber, and had reluctantly
turned back some fifty miles from Rome, what a reinforcement my longing
for the Eternal City had received from the impressions of my childhood.
I had just conceived a plan of travelling to Naples via Rome the following
year when this sentence, which I must have read in one of our German classics,
occurred to me: * "It is a question which of the two paced to and fro in
his room the more impatiently after he had conceived the plan of going
to Rome- Assistant Headmaster Winckelmann or the

<P>great General Hannibal." I myself had walked in Hannibal's footsteps;
like him I was destined never to see Rome, and he too had gone to Campania
when all were expecting him in Rome. Hannibal, with whom I had achieved
this point of similarity, had been my favourite hero during my years at
the Gymnasium; like so many boys of my age, I bestowed my sympathies in
the Punic war not on the Romans, but on the Carthaginians. Moreover, when
I finally came to realize the consequences of belonging to an alien race,
and was forced by the anti-Semitic feeling among my classmates to take
a definite stand, the figure of the Semitic commander assumed still greater
proportions in my imagination. Hannibal and Rome symbolized, in my youthful
eyes, the struggle between the tenacity of the Jews and the organization
of the Catholic Church. The significance for our emotional life which the
anti-Semitic movement has since assumed helped to fix the thoughts and
impressions of those earlier days. Thus the desire to go to Rome has in
my dream- life become the mask and symbol for a number of warmly cherished
wishes, for whose realization one had to work with the tenacity and single-mindedness
of the Punic general, though their fulfilment at times seemed as remote
as Hannibal's life-long wish to enter Rome. -

<P>* The writer in whose works I found this passage was probably Jean Paul
Richter. -

<P>&nbsp;And now, for the first time, I happened upon the youthful experience
which even to-day still expresses its power in all these emotions and dreams.
I might have been ten or twelve years old when my father began to take
me with him on his walks, and in his conversation to reveal his views on
the things of this world. Thus it was that he once told me the following
incident, in order to show me that I had been born into happier times than
he: "When I was a young man, I was walking one Saturday along the street
in the village where you were born; I was well-dressed, with a new fur
cap on my head. Up comes a Christian, who knocks my cap into the mud, and
shouts, 'Jew, get off the pavement!'"- "And what did you do?"- "I went
into the street and picked up the cap," he calmly replied. That did not
seem heroic on the part of the big, strong man who was leading me, a little
fellow, by the hand. I contrasted this situation, which did not please
me, with another, more in harmony with my sentiments- the scene in which
Hannibal's father, Hamilcar Barcas, made his son swear before the household
altar to take vengeance on the Romans. * Ever since then Hannibal has had
a place in my phantasies. -

<P>&nbsp;* In the first edition of this book I gave here the name "Hasdrubal,"
an amazing error, which I explained in my Psycho pathology of Everyday
Life. -

<P>&nbsp;I think I can trace my enthusiasm for the Carthaginian general
still further back into my childhood, so that it is probably only an instance
of an already established emotional relation being transferred to a new
vehicle. One of the first books which fell into my childish hands after
I learned to read was Thiers' Consulate and Empire. I remember that I pasted
on the flat backs of my wooden soldiers little labels bearing the names
of the Imperial marshals, and that at that time Massena (as a Jew, Menasse)
was already my avowed favourite. * This preference is doubtless also to
be explained by the fact of my having been born, a hundred years later,
on the same date. Napoleon himself is associated with Hannibal through
the crossing of the Alps. And perhaps the development of this martial ideal
may be traced yet farther back, to the first three years of my childhood,
to wishes which my alternately friendly and hostile relations with a boy
a year older than myself must have evoked in the weaker of the two playmates.
-

<P>* The Jewish descent of the Marshal is somewhat doubtful. -

<P>&nbsp;The deeper we go into the analysis of dreams, the more often are
we put on the track of childish experiences which play the part of dream-sources
in the latent dream-content.

<P>&nbsp;We have learned that dreams very rarely reproduce memories in
such a manner as to constitute, unchanged and unabridged, the sole manifest
dream-content. Nevertheless, a few authentic examples which show such reproduction
have been recorded, and I can add a few new ones, which once more refer
to scenes of childhood. In the case of one of my patients a dream once
gave a barely distorted reproduction of a sexual incident, which was immediately
recognized as an accurate recollection. The memory of it had never been
completely lost in the waking life, but it had been greatly obscured, and
it was revivified by the previous work of analysis. The dreamer had at
the age of twelve visited a bedridden schoolmate, who had exposed himself,
probably only by a chance movement in bed. At the sight of the boy's genitals
he was seized by a kind of compulsion, exposed himself, and took hold of
the member of the other boy who, however, looked at him in surprise and
indignation, whereupon he became embarrassed and let it go. A dream repeated
this scene twenty-three years later, with all the details of the accompanying
emotions, changing it, however, in this respect, that the dreamer played
the passive instead of the active role, while the person of the schoolmate
was replaced by a contemporary.

<P>&nbsp;As a rule, of course, a scene from childhood is represented in
the manifest dream-content only by an allusion, and must be disentangled
from the dream by interpretation. The citation of examples of this kind
cannot be very convincing, because any guarantee that they are really experiences
of childhood is lacking; if they belong to an earlier period of life, they
are no longer recognized by our memory. The conclusion that such childish
experiences recur at all in dreams is justified in psychoanalytic work
by a great number of factors, which in their combined results appear to
be sufficiently reliable. But when, for the purposes of dream-interpretation,
such references to childish experiences are torn out of their context,
they may not perhaps seem very impressive, especially where I do not even
give all the material upon which the interpretation is based. However,
I shall not let this deter me from giving a few examples. -

With one of my female patients all dreams have the character of hurry;
she is hurrying so as to be in time, so as not to miss her train, and so
on. In one dream she has to visit a girl friend; her mother had told her
to ride and not walk; she runs, however, and keeps on calling. The material
that emerged in the analysis allowed one to recognize a memory of childish
romping, and, especially for one dream, went back to the popular childish
game of rapidly repeating the words of a sentence as though it was all
one word. All these harmless jokes with little friends were remembered
because they replaced other less harmless ones. * -

<P>&nbsp;* In the original this paragraph contains many plays on the word

<P>Hetz (hurry, chase, scurry, game, etc.).- TR. -

<P>&nbsp;
<H3>
II.</H3>
The following dream was dreamed by another female patient: She is in a
large room in which there are all sorts of machines; it is rather like
what she would imagine an orthopaedic institute to

<P>be. She hears that I am pressed for time, and that she must undergo
treatment along with five others. But she resists, and is unwilling to
lie down on the bed- or whatever it is- which is intended for her. She
stands in a corner, and waits for me to say "It is not true." The others,
meanwhile, laugh at her, saying it is all foolishness on her part. At the
same time, it is as though she were called upon to make a number of little
squares.

<P>&nbsp;The first part of the content of this dream is an allusion to
the treatment and to the transference to myself. The second contains an
allusion to a scene of childhood; the two portions are connected by the
mention of the bed. The orthopaedic institute is an allusion to one of
my talks, in which I compared the treatment, with regard to its duration
and its nature. to an orthopaedic treatment. At the beginning of the treatment
I had to tell her that for the present I had little time to give her, but
that later on I would devote a whole hour to her daily. This aroused in
her the old sensitiveness, which is a leading characteristic of children
who are destined to become hysterical. Their desire for love is insatiable.
My patient was the youngest of six brothers and sisters (hence, with five
others), and as such her father's favourite, but in spite of this she seems
to have felt that her beloved father devoted far too little time and attention
to her. Her waiting for me to say It is not trite was derived as follows:
A little tailor's apprentice had brought her a dress, and she had given
him the money for it. Then she asked her husband whether she would have
to pay the money again if the boy were to lose it. To tease her, her husband
answered "Yes" (the teasing in the dream), and she asked again and again,
and waited for him to say "It is not true." The thought of the latent dream-
content may now be construed as follows: Will she have to pay me double
the amount when I devote twice as much time to her?- a thought which is
stingy or filthy (the uncleanliness of childhood is often replaced in dreams
by greed for money; the word filthy here supplies the bridge). If all the
passage referring to her waiting until I say It is not true is intended
in the dream as a circumlocution for the word dirty, the standingin-the-corner
and not lying-down-on-the-bed are in keeping with this word, as component
parts of a scene of her childhood in which she had soiled her bed, in punishment
for which she was put into the corner, with a warning that papa would not
love her any more, whereupon her brothers and sisters laughed at her, etc.
The little squares refer to her young niece, who showed her the arithmetical
trick of writing figures in nine squares (I think) in such a way that on
being added together in any direction they make fifteen. -

III.</H3>
Here is a man's dream: He sees two boys tussling with each other; they
are cooper's boys, as he concludes from the tools which are lying about;
one of the boys has thrown the other down; the prostrate boy is wearing
ear-rings with blue stones. He runs towards the assailant with lifted cane,
in order to chastise him. The boy takes refuge behind a woman, as though
she were his mother, who is standing against a wooden fence. She is the
wife of a day-labourer, and she turns her back to the man who is dreaming.
Finally she turns about and stares at him with a horrible look, so that
he runs away in terror; the red flesh of the lower lid seems to stand out
from her eyes.

<P>&nbsp;This dream has made abundant use of trivial occurrences from the
previous day, in the course of which he actually saw two boys in the street,
one of whom threw the other down. When he walked up to them in order to
settle the quarrel, both of them took to their heels. Cooper's boys- this
is explained only by a

<P>subsequent dream, in the analysis of which he used the proverbial expression:
"To knock the bottom out of the barrel." Ear-rings with blue stones, according
to his observation, are worn chiefly by prostitutes. This suggests a familiar
doggerel rhyme about two boys: "The other boy was called Marie": that is,
he was a girl. The woman standing by the fence: after the scene with the
two boys he went for a walk along the bank of the Danube and, taking advantage
of being alone, urinated against a wooden fence. A little farther on a
respectably dressed, elderly lady smiled at him very pleasantly and wanted
to hand him her card with her address.

<P>&nbsp;Since, in the dream, the woman stood as he had stood while urinating,
there is an allusion to a woman urinating, and this explains the horrible
look and the prominence of the red flesh, which can only refer to the genitals
gaping in a squatting posture; seen in childhood, they had appeared in
later recollection as proud flesh, as a wound. The dream unites two occasions
upon which, as a little boy, the dreamer was enabled to see the genitals
of little girls, once by throwing the little girl down, and once while
the child was urinating; and, as is shown by another association, he had
retained in his memory the punishment administered or threatened by his
father on account of these manifestations of sexual curiosity. -

IV.</H3>
A great mass of childish memories, which have been hastily combined into
a phantasy, may be found behind the following dream of an elderly lady:
She goes out in a hurry to do some shopping. On the Graben she sinks to
her knees as though she had broken down. A number of people collect around
her, especially cabdrivers, but no one helps her to get up. She makes many
vain attempts; finally she must have succeeded, for she is put into a cab
which is to take her home. A large, heavily laden basket (something like
a market- basket) is thrown after her through the window.

<P>&nbsp;This is the woman who is always harassed in her dreams; just as
she used to be harassed when a child. The first situation of the dream
is apparently taken from the sight of a fallen horse; just as broken down
points to horse-racing. In her youth she was a rider; still earlier she
was probably also a horse. With the idea of falling down is connected her
first childish reminiscence of the seventeen-year-old son of the hall porter,
who had an epileptic seizure in the street and was brought home in a cab.
Of this, of course, she had only heard, but the idea of epileptic fits,
of falling down, acquired a great influence over her phantasies, and later
on influenced the form of her own hysterical attacks. When a person of
the female sex dreams of falling, this almost always has a sexual significance;
she becomes a fallen woman, and, for the purpose of the dream under consideration,
this interpretation is probably the least doubtful, for she falls in the
Graben, the street in Vienna which is known as the concourse of prostitutes.
The market-basket admits of more than one interpretation; in the sense
of refusal (German, Korb = basket = snub, refusal) it reminds her of the
many snubs which she at first administered to her suitors and which, she
thinks, she herself received later. This agrees with the detail: no one
will help her up, which she herself interprets as being disdained. Further,
the market-basket recalls phantasies which have already appeared in the
course of analysis, in which she imagines that she has married far beneath
her station and now goes to the market as a market-woman. Lastly, the market-
basket might be interpreted as the mark of a servant. This suggests further
memories of her childhood- of a cook who was discharged because she stole;
she, too, sank to her knees and begged for mercy. The dreamer was at that
time twelve years of age. Then emerges a recollection of a chamber-maid,
who was dismissed because she had an affair with the coachman of the household,
who, incidentally, married her afterwards. This recollection, therefore,
gives us a clue to the cab-drivers in the dream (who, in opposition to
the reality, do not stand by the fallen woman). But there still remains
to be explained the throwing of the basket; in particular, why it is thrown
through the window? This reminds her of the forwarding of luggage by rail,
to the custom of Fensterln * in the country, and to trivial impressions
of a summer resort, of a gentleman who threw some blue plums into the window
of a lady's room, and of her little sister, who was frightened because
an idiot who was passing looked in at the window. And now, from behind
all this emerges an obscure recollection from her tenth year of a nurse
in the country to whom one of the men-servants made love (and whose conduct
the child may have noticed), and who was sent packing, thrown out, together
with her lover (in the dream we have the expression: thrown into); an incident
which we have been approaching by several other paths. The luggage or box
of a servant is disparagingly described in Vienna as "seven plums." "Pack
up your seven plums and get out!" -

<P>&nbsp;* Fensterln is the custom, now falling into disuse, found in rural
districts of the German Schwarzwald, of lovers who woo their sweethearts
at their bedroom windows, to which they ascend by means of a ladder, enjoying
such intimacy that the relation practically amounts to a trial marriage.
The reputation of the young woman never suffers on account of Fensterln,
unless she becomes intimate with too many suitors.- TR. -

<P>&nbsp;My collection, of course, contains a plethora of such patients'
dreams, the analysis of which leads back to impressions of childhood, often
dating back to the first three years of life, which are remembered obscurely,
or not at all. But it is a questionable proceeding to draw conclusions
from these and apply them to dreams in general, for they are mostly dreams
of neurotic, and especially hysterical, persons; and the part played in
these dreams by childish scenes might be conditioned by the nature of the
neurosis, and not by the nature of dreams in general. In the interpretation
of my own dreams, however, which is assuredly not undertaken on account
of grave symptoms of illness, it happens just as frequently that in the
latent dreamcontent I am unexpectedly confronted with a scene of my childhood,
and that a whole series of my dreams will suddenly converge upon the paths
proceeding from a single childish experience. I have already given examples
of this, and I shall give yet more in different connections. Perhaps I
cannot close this chapter more fittingly than by citing several dreams
of my own, in which recent events and long-forgotten experiences of my
childhood appear together as dream-sources.

<H3>
I.</H3>
After I have been travelling, and have gone to bed hungry and tired, the
prime necessities of life begin to assert their claims in sleep, and I
dream as follows: I go into a kitchen in order to ask for some pudding.
There three women are standing, one of whom is the hostess; she is rolling
something in her hands, as though she were making dumplings. She replies
that I must wait until she has finished (not distinctly as a speech). I
become impatient, and go away affronted. I want to put on an overcoat;
but the first I try on is too long. I take it off, and am somewhat astonished
to find that it is trimmed with fur. A second coat has a long strip of
cloth with a Turkish design sewn into it. A stranger with a long face and
a short, pointed beard comes up and

<P>prevents me from putting it on, declaring that it belongs to him. I
now show him that it is covered all over with Turkish embroideries. He
asks: "How do the Turkish (drawings, strips of cloth...) concern you?"
But we soon become quite friendly.

<P>&nbsp;In the analysis of this dream I remember, quite unexpectedly,
the first novel which I ever read, or rather, which I began to read from
the end of the first volume, when I was perhaps thirteen years of age.
I have never learned the name of the novel, or that of its author, but
the end remains vividly in my memory. The hero becomes insane, and continually
calls out the names of the three women who have brought the greatest happiness
and the greatest misfortune into his life. Pelagie is one of these names.
I still do not know what to make of this recollection during the analysis.
Together with the three women there now emerge the three Parcae, who spin
the fates of men, and I know that one of the three women, the hostess in
the dream, is the mother who gives life, and who, moreover, as in my own
case, gives the child its first nourishment. Love and hunger meet at the
mother's breast. A young man- so runs an anecdote- who became a great admirer
of womanly beauty, once observed, when the conversation turned upon the
handsome wet-nurse who had suckled him as a child, that he was sorry that
he had not taken better advantage of his opportunities. I am in the habit
of using the anecdote to elucidate the factor of retrospective tendencies
in the mechanism of the psychoneuroses. One of the Parcae, then, is rubbing
the palms of her hands together, as though she were making dumplings. A
strange occupation for one of the Fates, and urgently in need of explanation!
This explanation is furnished by another and earlier memory of my childhood.
When I was six years old, and receiving my first lessons from my mother,
I was expected to believe that we are made of dust, and must, therefore,
return to dust. But this did not please me, and I questioned the doctrine.
Thereupon my mother rubbed the palms of her hands together-just as in making
dumplings, except that there was no dough between them- and showed me the
blackish scales of epidermis which were thus rubbed off, as a proof that
it is of dust that we are made. Great was my astonishment at this demonstration
ad oculos, and I acquiesced in the idea which I was later to hear expressed
in the words: "Thou owest nature a death." * Thus the women to whom I go
in the kitchen, as I so often did in my childhood when I was hungry and
my mother, sitting by the fire, admonished me to wait until lunch was ready,
are really the Parcae. And now for the dumplings! At least one of my teachers
at the University- the very one to whom I am indebted for my histological
knowledge (epidermis)- would be reminded by the name Knodl (Knodl means
dumpling), of a person whom he had to prosecute for plagiarizing his writings.
Committing a plagiarism, taking anything one can lay hands on, even though
it belongs to another, obviously leads to the second part of the dream,
in which I am treated like the overcoat thief who for some time plied his
trade in the lecture halls. I have written the word plagiarism- without
definite intention- because it occurred to me, and now I see that it must
belong to the latent dream-content and that it will serve as a bridge between
the different parts of the manifest dream-content. The chain of associations-
Pelagie- plagiarism- plagiostomi *(2) (sharks)- fish-bladder- connects
the old novel with the affair of Knodl and the overcoats (German: Uberzieher
= pullover, overcoat or condom), which obviously refer to an appliance
appertaining to the technique of sex. This, it is true, is a very forced
and irrational connection, but it is nevertheless one which I could not
have established in waking life if it had not already been established
by the dream-work. Indeed, as though nothing were sacred to this impulse
to enforce associations, the beloved name, Brucke (bridge of words, see
above), now serves to remind me of the very institute in which I spent
my happiest hours as a

<P>student, wanting for nothing. "So will you at the breasts of Wisdom
every day more pleasure find"), in the most complete contrast to the desires
which plague me (German: plagen) while I dream. And finally, there emerges
the recollection of another dear teacher, whose name once more sounds like
something edible (Fleischl- Fleisch = meat- like Knodl = dumplings), and
of a pathetic scene in which the scales of epidermis play a part (mother-
hostess), and mental derangement (the novel), and a remedy from the Latin
pharmacopeia (Kuche = kitchen) which numbs the sensation of hunger, namely,
cocaine.

<P>&nbsp;* Both the affects pertaining to these childish scenes- astonishment
and resignation to the inevitable- appeared in a dream of slightly earlier
date, which first reminded me of this incident of my childhood.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) I do not bring in the plagiostomi arbitrarily; they recall
a painful incident of disgrace before the same teacher.

<P>&nbsp;In this manner I could follow the intricate trains of thought
still farther, and could fully elucidate that part of the dream which is
lacking in the analysis; but I must refrain, because the personal sacrifice
which this would involve is too great. I shall take up only one of the
threads, which will serve to lead us directly to one of the dream-thoughts
that lie at the bottom of the medley. The stranger with the long face and
pointed beard, who wants to prevent me from putting on the overcoat, has
the features of a tradesman of Spalato, of whom my wife bought a great
deal of Turkish cloth. His name was Popovic, a suspicious name, which even
gave the humorist Stettenheim a pretext for a suggestive remark: "He told
me his name, and blushingly shook my hand." * For the rest, I find the
same misuse of names as above in the case of Pelagie, Knodl, Brucke, Fleischl.
No one will deny that such playing with names is a childish trick; if I
indulge in it the practice amounts to an act of retribution, for my own
name has often enough been the subject of such feeble attempts at wit.
Goethe once remarked how sensitive a man is in respect to his name, which
he feels that he fills even as he fills his skin; Herder having written
the following lines on his name:

<P>&nbsp;Der du von Gottern abstammst, von Gothen oder vom Kote.

<P>&nbsp;So seid ihr Gotterbilder auch zu Staub. -

<P>&nbsp;[Thou who art born of the gods, of the Goths, or of the mud. Thus
are thy godlike images even dust.] -

<P>&nbsp;I realize that this digression on the misuse of names was intended
merely to justify this complaint. But here let us stop.... The purchase
at Spalato reminds me of another purchase at Cattaro, where I was too cautious,
and missed the opportunity of making an excellent bargain. (Missing an
opportunity at the breast of the wet- nurse; see above.) One of the dream-thoughts
occasioned by the sensation of hunger really amounts to this: We should
let nothing escape; we should take what we can get, even if we do a little
wrong; we should never let an opportunity go by; life is so short, and
death inevitable. Because this is meant even sexually, and because desire
is unwilling to check itself before the thought of doing wrong, this philosophy
of carpe diem has reason to fear the censorship, and must conceal itself
behind a dream. And so all sorts of counter-thoughts find expression, with
recollections of the time when spiritual nourishment alone was sufficient
for the dreamer, with hindrances of every kind and

<P>even threats of disgusting sexual punishments. -

<P>&nbsp;* Popo = "backside," in German nursery language. -

II.</H3>
A second dream requires a longer preliminary statement:

<P>&nbsp;I had driven to the Western Station in order to start on a holiday
trip to the Aussee, but I went on to the platform in time for the Ischl
train, which leaves earlier. There I saw Count Thun, who was again going
to see the Emperor at Ischl. In spite of the rain he arrived in an open
carriage, came straight through the entrance- gate for the local trains,
and with a curt gesture and not a word of explanation he waved back the
gatekeeper, who did not know him and wanted to take his ticket. After he
had left in the Ischl train, I was asked to leave the platform and return
to the waiting- room; but after some difficulty I obtained permission to
remain. I passed the time noting how many people bribed the officials to
secure a compartment; I fully intended to make a complaint- that is, to
demand the same privilege. Meanwhile I sang something to myself, which
I afterwards recognized as the aria from The Marriage of Figaro: -

<P>&nbsp;If my lord Count would tread a measure, tread a measure, Let him
but say his pleasure,

<P>&nbsp;And I will play the tune. -

<P>&nbsp;(Possibly another person would not have recognized the tune.)
The whole evening I was in a high-spirited, pugnacious mood; I chaffed
the waiter and the cab-driver, I hope without hurting their feelings; and
now all kinds of bold and revolutionary thoughts came into my mind, such
as would fit themselves to the words of Figaro, and to memories of Beaumarchais'
comedy, of which I had seen a performance at the Comedie Francaise. The

<P>speech about the great men who have taken the trouble to be born; the
seigneurial right which Count Almaviva wishes to exercise with regard to
Susanne; the jokes which our malicious Opposition journalists make on the
name of Count Thun (German, thun = do), calling him Graf Nichtsthun, Count-Do-Nothing.
I really do not envy him; he now has a difficult audience with the Emperor
before him, and it is I who am the real Count-Do-Nothing, for I am going
off for a holiday. I make all sorts of amusing plans for the vacation.
Now a gentleman arrives whom I know as a Government representative at the
medical examinations, and who has won the flattering nickname of "the Governmental
bed-fellow" (literally, by-sleeper) by his activities in this capacity.
By insisting on his official status he secured half a first-class compartment,
and I heard one guard say to another: "Where are we going to put the gentleman
with the first-class half-compartment?" A pretty sort of favouritism! I
am paying for a whole first-class compartment. I did actually get a whole
compartment to myself, but not in a through carriage, so there was no lavatory
at my disposal during the night. My complaints to the guard were fruitless;
I revenged myself by suggesting that at least a hole be made in the floor
of this compartment, to serve the possible needs of passengers. At a quarter
to three in the morning I wake, with an urgent desire to urinate, from
the following dream:

<P>&nbsp;A crowd, a students' meeting.... A certain Count (Thun or Taaffe)
is making a speech. Being asked to say something about the Germans, he
declares, with a contemptuous gesture, that their favourite flower is coltsfoot,
and he then puts into his buttonhole something like a torn leaf, really
the crumpled skeleton of a leaf. I jump up, and I jump up, * but I am surprised
at my implied attitude. Then, more indistinctly: It seems as though this
were the vestibule (Aula); the exits are thronged, and one must escape.
I make my way through a suite of handsomely appointed rooms, evidently
ministerial apartments, with furniture of a colour between brown and violet,
and at last I come to a corridor in which a housekeeper, a fat, elderly
woman, is seated. I try to avoid speaking to her, but she apparently thinks
I have a right to pass this way, because she asks whether she shall accompany
me with the lamp. I indicate with a gesture, or tell her, that she is to
remain standing on the stairs, and it seems to me that I am very clever,
for after all I am evading detection. Now I am downstairs, and I find a
narrow, steeply rising path, which I follow. -

<P>&nbsp;* This repetition has crept into the text of the dream, apparently
through absent-mindedness, and I have left it because analysis shows that
it has a meaning. -

<P>&nbsp;Again indistinctly: It is as though my second task were to get
away from the city, just as my first was to get out of the building. I
am riding in a one-horse cab, and I tell the driver to take me to a railway
station. "I can't drive with you on the railway line itself," I say, when
he reproaches me as though I had tired him out. Here it seems as though
I had already made a journey in his cab which is usually made by rail.
The stations are crowded; I am wondering whether to go to Krems or to Znaim,
but I reflect that the Court will be there, and I decide in favour of Graz
or some such place. Now I am seated in the railway carriage, which is rather
like a tram, and I have in my buttonhole a peculiar long braided thing,
on which are violet-brown violets of stiff material, which makes a great
impression on people. Here the scene breaks off.

<P>&nbsp;I am once more in front of the railway station, but I am in the
company of an elderly gentleman. I think out a scheme for remaining unrecognized,
but I see this plan already being carried out. Thinking and experiencing
are here, as it were, the same thing. He pretends to be blind, at least
in one eye, and I hold before him a male glass urinal (which we have to
buy in the city, or have bought). I am thus a sick-nurse, and have to give
him the urinal because he is blind. If the conductor sees us in this position,
he must pass us by without drawing attention to us. At the same time the
position of the elderly man, and his urinating organ, is plastically perceived.
Then I wake with a desire to urinate.

<P>&nbsp;The whole dream seems a sort of phantasy, which takes the dreamer
back to the year of revolution, 1848, the memory of which had been revived
by the jubilee of 1898, as well as by a little excursion to Wachau, on
which I visited Emmersdorf, the refuge of the student leader Fischof, *
to whom several features of the manifest dream- content might refer. The
association of ideas then leads me to England, to the house of my brother,
who used in jest to twit his wife with the title of Tennyson's poem Fifty
Years Ago, whereupon the children were used to correct him: Fifteen Years
Ago. This phantasy, however, which attaches itself to the thoughts evoked
by the sight of Count Thun, is, like the facade of an Italian church, without
organic connection with the structure behind it, but unlike such a facade
it is full of gaps, and confused, and in many places portions of the interior
break through. The first situation of the dream is made up of a number
of scenes, into which I am able to dissect it. The arrogant attitude of
the Count in the dream is copied from a scene at my school which occurred
in my fifteenth year. We had hatched a conspiracy against an unpopular
and ignorant teacher; the leading spirit in this conspiracy was a schoolmate
who since that time seems to have taken Henry VIII of England as his model.
It fell to me to carry out the coup d'etat, and a discussion of the importance
of the Danube (German, Donau) to Austria (Wachau!) was the occasion of
an open revolt. One of our fellow-conspirators was our only aristocratic
schoolmate- he was called "the giraffe" on account of his conspicuous height-
and while he was being reprimanded by the tyrant of the school, the professor
of the German language, he stood just as the Count stood in the dream.
The explanation of the favourite flower, and the putting into a button-hole
of something that must have been a flower (which recalls the orchids which
I had given that day to a friend, and also a rose of Jericho) prominently
recalls the incident in Shakespeare's historical play which opens the civil
wars of the Red and the White Roses; the mention of Henry VIII has paved
the way to this reminiscence. Now it is not very far from roses to red
and white carnations. (Meanwhile two little rhymes, the one German, the
other Spanish, insinuate themselves into the analysis: Rosen, Tulpen, Nelken,
alle Blumen welken, *(2) and Isabelita, no llores, que se marchitan las
flores. *(3) The Spanish line occurs in Figaro.) Here in Vienna white carnations
have become the badge of the Anti-Semites, red ones of the Social Democrats.
Behind this is the recollection of an anti-Semitic challenge during a railway
journey in beautiful Saxony (Anglo Saxon). The third scene contributing
to the formation of the first situation in the dream dates from my early
student days. There was a debate in a German students' club about the relation
of philosophy to the general sciences. Being a green youth, full of materialistic
doctrines, I thrust myself forward in order to defend an extremely one-sided
position. Thereupon a sagacious older fellow- student, who has since then
shown his capacity for leading men and organizing the masses, and who,
moreover, bears a name belonging to the animal kingdom, rose and gave us
a thorough dressing-down; he too, he said, had herded swine in his youth,
and had then returned repentant to his father's house. I jumped up (as
in the dream), became piggishly rude, and retorted that since I knew he
had herded swine, I was not surprised at the tone of his discourse. (In
the dream I am surprised at my German Nationalistic feelings.) There was
a great commotion, and an almost general demand that I should retract my
words, but I stood my ground. The insulted student was too sensible to
take the advice which was offered him, that he should send me a challenge,
and let the matter drop. -

<P>&nbsp;* This is an error and not a slip, for I learned later that the
Emmersdorf in Wachau is not identical with the refuge of the revolutionist
Fischof, a place of the same name.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) Roses, tulips, and carnations, flowers all will wither.

<P>&nbsp;*(3) Do not cry, little Isabella because your flowers have faded.

<P>&nbsp;The remaining elements of this scene of the dream are of more
remote origin. What does it mean that the Count should make a scornful
reference to coltsfoot? Here I must question my train of associations.
Coltsfoot (German: Huflattich), Lattice (lettuce), Salathund (the dog that
grudges others what he cannot eat himself). Here plenty of opprobrious
epithets may be discerned: Gir-affe (German: Affe = monkey, ape), pig,
sow, dog; I might even arrive, by way of the name, at donkey, and thereby
pour contempt upon an academic professor. Furthermore, I translate coltsfoot
(Huflattich)- I do not know whether I do so correctly- by pisse-en-lit.
I get this idea from Zola's Germinal, in which some children are told to
bring some dandelion salad with them. The dog- chien- has a name sounding
not unlike the verb for the major function (chier, as pisser stands for
the minor one). Now we shall soon have the indecent in all its three physical
categories, for in the same Germinal, which deals with the future revolution,
there is a description of a very peculiar contest, which relates to the
production of the gaseous excretions known as flatus. * And now I cannot
but observe how the way to this flatus has been prepared a long while since,
beginning with the flowers, and proceeding to the Spanish rhyme of Isabelita,
to Ferdinand and Isabella, and, by way of Henry VIII, to English history
at the time of the Armada, after the victorious termination of which the
English struck a medal with the inscription: Flavit et dissipati sunt,
for the storm had scattered the Spanish fleet. *(2) I had thought of using
this phrase, half jestingly, as the title of a chapter on "Therapy," if
I should ever succeed in giving a detailed account of my conception and
treatment of hysteria. -

<P>&nbsp;* Not in Germinal, but in La Terre- a mistake of which I became
aware only in the analysis. Here I would call attention to the identity
of letters in Huflattich and Flatus.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) An unsolicited biographer, Dr. F. Wittels, reproaches me
for having omitted the name of Jehovah from the above motto. The English
medal contains the name of the Deity, in Hebrew letters, on the background
of a cloud, and placed in such a manner that one may equally well regard
it as part of the picture or as part of the inscription.

<P>&nbsp;I cannot give so detailed an interpretation of the second scene
of the dream, out of sheer regard for the censorship. For at this point
I put myself in the place of a certain eminent gentleman of the revolutionary
period, who had an adventure with an eagle (German: Adler) and who is said
to have suffered from incontinence of the bowels, incontinentia and, etc.;
and here I believe that I should not be justified in passing the censorship,
even though it was an aulic councillor (aula, consiliarizis aulicus) who
told me the greater part of this history. The suite of rooms in the dream
is suggested by his Excellency's private saloon carriage, into which I
was able to glance; but it means, as it so often does in dreams, a woman.
* The personality of the housekeeper is an ungrateful allusion to a witty
old lady, which ill repays her for the good times and the many good stories
which I have enjoyed in her house. The incident of the lamp goes back to
Grillparzer, who notes a charming experience of a similar nature, of which
he afterwards made use in Hero and Leander (the waves of the sea and of
love- the Armada and the storm). -

<P>&nbsp;* Frauenzimmer, German, Zimmer-room, is appended to Frauen-woman,
in order to imply a slight contempt.- TR. -

<P>&nbsp;I must forego a detailed analysis of the two remaining portions
of the dream; I shall single out only those elements which lead me back
to the two scenes of my childhood for the sake of which alone I have selected
the dream. The reader will rightly assume that it is sexual material which
necessitates the suppression; but he may not be content with this explanation.
There are many things of which one makes no secret to oneself, but which
must be treated as secrets in addressing others, and here we are concerned
not with the reasons which induce me to conceal the solution, but with
the motive of the inner censorship which conceals the real content of the
dream even from myself. Concerning this, I will confess that the analysis
reveals these three portions of the dream as impertinent boasting, the
exuberance of an absurd megalomania, long ago suppressed in my waking life,
which, however, dares to show itself, with individual ramifications, even
in the manifest dream- content (it seems to me that I am a cunning fellow),
making the high-spirited mood of the evening before the dream perfectly
intelligible.

<P>Boasting of every kind, indeed thus, the mention of Graz points to the
phrase: "What price Graz?" which one is wont to use when one feels unusually
wealthy. Readers who recall Master Rabelais's inimitable description of
the life and deeds of Gargantua and his son Pantagruel will be able to
enroll even the suggested content of the first portion of the dream among
the boasts to which I have alluded. But the following belongs to the two
scenes of childhood of which I have spoken: I had bought a new trunk for
this journey, the colour of which, a brownish violet, appears in the dream
several times (violet-brown violets of a stiff cloth, on an object which
is known as a girl-catcher- the furniture in the ministerial chambers).
Children, we know, believe that one attracts people's attention with anything
new. Now I have been told of the following incident of my childhood; my
recollection of the occurrence itself has been replaced by my recollection
of the story. I am told that at the age of two I still used occasionally
to wet my bed, and that when I was reproved for doing so I consoled my
father by promising to buy him a beautiful new red bed in N (the nearest
large town). Hence, the interpolation in the dream, that we had bought
the urinal in the city or had to buy it; one must keep one's promises.
(One should note, moreover, the association of the male urinal and the
woman's trunk, box.) All the megalomania of the child is contained in this
promise. The significance of dreams of urinary difficulties in the case
of children has already been considered in the interpretation of an earlier
dream (cf. the dream in chapter V., A.). The psycho-analysis of neurotics
has taught us to recognize the intimate connection between wetting the
bed and the character trait of ambition.

<P>&nbsp;Then, when I was seven or eight years of age another domestic
incident occurred which I remember very well. One evening, before going
to bed, I had disregarded the dictates of discretion, and had satisfied
my needs in my parents' bedroom, and in their presence. Reprimanding me
for this delinquency, my father remarked: "That boy will never amount to
anything." This must have been a terrible affront to my ambition, for allusions
to this scene recur again and again in my dreams, and are constantly coupled
with enumerations of my accomplishments and successes, as though I wanted
to say: "You see, I have amounted to something after all." This childish
scene furnishes the elements for the last image of the dream, in which
the roles are interchanged, of course for the purpose of revenge. The elderly
man obviously my father, for the blindness in one eye signifies his one-sided
glaucoma, * is now urinating before me as I once urinated before him. By
means of the glaucoma I remind my father of cocaine, which stood him in
good stead during his operation, as though I had thereby fulfilled my promise.
Besides, I make sport of him; since he is blind, I must hold the glass
in front of him, and I delight in allusions to my knowledge of the theory
of hysteria, of which I am proud. *(2)

<P>&nbsp;* Another interpretation: He is one-eyed like Odin, the father
of the gods- Odin's consolation. The consolation in the childish scene:
I will buy him a new bed.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) Here is some more material for interpretation: Holding the
urine-glass recalls the story of a peasant (illiterate) at the optician's,
who tried on now one pair of spectacles, now another, but was still unable
to read.- (Peasant-catcher- girl-catcher in the preceding portion of the
dream.)- The peasants' treatment of the feeble-minded father in Zola's
La Terre.- The tragic atonement, that in his last days my father soiled
his bed like a child; hence, I am his nurse in the dream.- "Thinking and
experiencing are here, as it were, identical"; this recalls a highly revolutionary
closet drama by Oscar Panizza, in which God, the Father, is ignominiously
treated as a palsied greybeard. With Him will and deed are one, and in
the book he has to be restrained by His archangel, a sort of Ganymede,
from scolding and swearing, because His curses would immediately be fulfilled.-
Making plans is a reproach against my father, dating from a later period
in the development of the critical faculty, much as the whole rebellious
content of the dream, which commits lese majeste and scorns authority,
may be traced to a revolt against my father. The sovereign is called the
father of his country (Landesvater), and the father is the first and oldest,
and for the child the only authority, from whose absolutism the other social
authorities have evolved in the course of the history of human civilization
(in so far as mother-right does not necessitate a qualification of this
doctrine).- The words which occurred to me in the dream, "thinking and
experiencing are the same thing," refer to the explanation of hysterical
symptoms with which the male urinal (glass) is also associated.- I need
not explain the principle of Gschnas to a Viennese; it consists in constructing
objects of rare and costly appearance out of trivial, and preferably comical
and worthless material- for example, making suits of armour out of kitchen
utensils, wisps of straw and Salzstangeln (long rolls), as our artists
are fond of doing at their jolly parties. I had learned that hysterical
subjects do the same thing; besides what really happens to them, they unconsciously
conceive for themselves horrible or extravagantly fantastic incidents,
which they build up out of the most harmless and commonplace material of
actual experience. The symptoms attach themselves primarily to these phantasies,
not to the memory of real events, whether serious or trivial. This explanation
had helped me to overcome many difficulties, and afforded me much pleasure.
I was able to allude to it by means of the dream-element "male urine-glass,"
because I had been told that at the last Gschnas evening a poison-chalice
of Lucretia Borgia's had been exhibited, the chief constituent of which
had consisted of a glass urinal for men, such as is used in hospitals.

<P>&nbsp;If the two childish scenes of urination are, according to my theory,
closely associated with the desire for greatness, their resuscitation on
the journey to the Aussee was further favoured by the accidental circumstance
that my compartment had no lavatory, and that I must be prepared to postpone
relief during the journey, as actually happened in the morning when I woke
with the sensation of a bodily need. I suppose one might be inclined to
credit this sensation with being the actual stimulus of the dream; I should,
however, prefer a different explanation, namely, that the dream- thoughts
first gave rise to the desire to urinate. It is quite unusual for me to
be disturbed in sleep by any physical need, least of all at the time when
I woke on this occasion- a quarter to four in the morning. I would forestall
a further objection by remarking that I have hardly ever felt a desire
to urinate after waking early on other journeys made under more comfortable
circumstances. However, I can leave this point undecided without weakening
my argument.

<P>&nbsp;Further, since experience in dream-analysis has drawn my attention
to the fact that even from dreams the interpretation of which seems at
first sight complete, because the dream-sources and the wish- stimuli are
easily demonstrable, important trains of thought proceed which reach back
into the earliest years of childhood, I had to ask myself whether this
characteristic does not even constitute an essential condition of dreaming.
If it were permissible to generalize this notion, I should say that every
dream is connected through its manifest content with recent experiences,
while through its latent content it is connected with the most remote experiences;
and I can actually show in the analysis of hysteria that these remote experiences
have in a very real sense remained recent right up to the present. But
I still find it very difficult to prove this conjecture; I shall have to
return to the probable role in dream-formation of the earliest experiences
of our childhood in another connection (chapter VII).

<P>&nbsp;Of the three peculiarities of the dream-memory considered above,
one- the preference for the unimportant in the dream-content- has been
satisfactorily explained by tracing it back to dream distortion. We have
succeeded in establishing the existence of the other two peculiarities-
the preferential selection of recent and also of infantile material- but
we have found it impossible to derive them from the motives of the dream.
Let us keep in mind these two characteristics, which we still have to explain
or evaluate; a place will have to be found for them elsewhere, either in
the discussion of the psychology of the sleeping state, or in the consideration
of the structure of the psychic apparatus- which we shall undertake later
after we have seen that by means of dream-interpretation we are able to
glance as through an inspection- hole into the interior of this apparatus.

<P>&nbsp;But here and now I will emphasize another result of the last few
dream-analyses. The dream often appears to have several meanings; not only
may several wish-fulfilments be combined in it, as our examples show, but
one meaning or one wish-fulfilment may conceal another. until in the lowest
stratum one comes upon the fulfilment of a wish from the earliest period
of childhood; and here again it may be questioned whether the word often
at the beginning of this sentence may not more correctly be replaced by
constantly. * -

<P>&nbsp;*The stratification of the meanings of dreams is one of the most
delicate but also one of the most fruitful problems of dream interpretation.
Whoever forgets the possibility of such stratification is likely to go
astray and to make untenable assertions concerning the nature of dreams.
But hitherto this subject has been only too imperfectly investigated. So
far, a fairly orderly stratification of symbols in dreams due to urinary
stimulus has been subjected to a thorough evaluation only by Otto Rank.

C. The Somatic Sources of Dreams</H3>
If we attempt to interest a cultured layman in the problems of dreams,
and if, with this end in view, we ask him what he believes to be the source
of dreams, we shall generally find that he feels quite sure he knows at
least this part of the solution. He thinks immediately of the influence
exercised on the formation of dreams by a disturbed or impeded digestion
("Dreams come from the stomach"), an accidental position of the body, a
trifling occurrence during sleep. He does not seem to suspect that even
after all these factors have been duly considered something still remains
to be explained.

<P>&nbsp;In the introductory chapter we examined at length the opinion
of scientific writers on the role of somatic stimuli in the formation of
dreams, so that here we need only recall the results of this inquiry. We
have seen that three kinds of somatic stimuli will be distinguished: the
objective sensory stimuli which proceed from external objects, the inner
states of excitation of the sensory organs, having only a subjective reality,
and the bodily stimuli arising within the body; and we have also noticed
that the writers on dreams are inclined to thrust into the background any
psychic sources of dreams which may operate simultaneously with the somatic
stimuli, or to exclude them altogether. In testing the claims made on behalf
of these somatic stimuli we have learned that the significance of the objective
excitation of the sensory organs- whether accidental stimuli operating
during sleep, or such as cannot be excluded from the dormant relation of
these dream-images and ideas to the internal bodily stimuli and confirmed
by experiment; that the part played by the subjective sensory stimuli appears
to be demonstrated by the recurrence of hypnagogic sensory images in dreams;
and that, although the broadly accepted relation of these dream-images
and ideas to the internal bodily stimuli cannot be exhaustively demonstrated,
it is at all events confirmed by the well-known influence which an excited
state of the digestive, urinary and sexual organs exercises upon the content
of our dreams.

<P>&nbsp;Nerve stimulus and bodily stimulus would thus be the anatomical
sources of dreams; that is, according to many writers, the sole and exclusive
sources of dreams.

<P>&nbsp;But we have already considered a number of doubtful points, which
seem to question not so much the correctness of the somatic theory as its
adequacy.

<P>&nbsp;However confident the representatives of this theory may be of
its factual basis- especially in respect of the accidental and external
nerve stimuli, which may without difficulty be recognized in the dream-content-
nevertheless they have all come near to admitting that the rich content
of ideas found in dreams cannot be derived from the external nerve-stimuli
alone. In this connection Miss Mary Whiton Calkins tested her own dreams,
and those of a second person, for a period of six weeks, and found that
the element of external sensory perception was demonstrable in only 13.2
per cent and 6.7 percent of these dreams respectively. Only two dreams
in the whole collection could be referred to organic sensations. These
statistics confirm what a cursory survey of our own experience would already,
have led us to suspect.

<P>&nbsp;A distinction has often been made between nerve-stimulus dreams
which have already been thoroughly investigated, and other forms of dreams.
Spitta, for example, divided dreams into nervestimulus dreams and association-dreams.
But it was obvious that this solution remained unsatisfactory unless the
link between the somatic sources of dreams and their ideational content
could be indicated.

<P>&nbsp;In addition to the first objection, that of the insufficient frequency
of the external sources of stimulus, a second objection presents itself,
namely, the inadequacy of the explanations of dreams afforded by this category
of dream-sources. There are two things which the representatives of this
theory have failed to explain: firstly, why the true nature of the external
stimulus is not recognized in the dream, but is constantly mistaken for
something else; and secondly, why the result of the reaction of the perceiving
mind to this misconceived stimulus should be so indeterminate and variable.
We have seen that Strumpell, in answer to these questions, asserts that
the mind, since it turns away from the outer world during sleep, is not
in a position to give the correct interpretation of the objective sensory
stimulus, but is forced to construct illusions on the basis of the indefinite
stimulation arriving from many directions. In his own words (Die Natur
und Entstehung der Traume, p. 108).

<P>&nbsp;"When by an external or internal nerve-stimulus during sleep a
feeling, or a complex of feelings, or any sort of psychic process arises
in the mind, and is perceived by the mind, this process calls up from the
mind perceptual images belonging to the sphere of the waking experiences,
that is to say, earlier perceptions, either unembellished, or with the
psychic values appertaining to them. It collects about itself, as it were,
a greater or lesser number of such images, from which the impression resulting
from the nerve-stimulus receives its psychic value. In this connection
it is commonly said, as in ordinary language we say of the waking procedure,
that the mind interprets in sleep the impressions of nervous stimuli. The
result of this interpretation is the socalled nerve-stimulus dream- that
is, a dream the components of which are conditioned by the fact that a
nerve-stimulus produces its psychical effect in the life of the mind in
accordance with the laws of reproduction."

<P>&nbsp;In all essential points identical with this doctrine is Wundt's
statement that the concepts of dreams proceed, at all events for the most
part, from sensory stimuli, and especially from the stimuli of general
sensation, and are therefore mostly phantastic illusions- probably only
to a small extent pure memoryconceptions raised to the condition of hallucinations.
To illustrate the relation between dream-content and dream-stimuli which
follows from this theory, Strumpell makes use of an excellent simile. It
is "as though ten fingers of a person ignorant of music were to stray over
the keyboard of an instrument." The implication is that the dream is not
a psychic phenomenon, originating from psychic motives, but the result
of a physiological stimulus, which expresses itself in psychic symptomatology
because the apparatus affected by the stimulus is not capable of any other
mode of expression. Upon a similar assumption is based the explanation
of obsessions which Meynert attempted in his famous simile of the dial
on which individual figures are most deeply embossed.

<P>&nbsp;Popular though this theory of the somatic dream-stimuli has become,
and seductive though it may seem, it is none the less easy to detect its
weak point. Every somatic dream-stimulus which provokes the psychic apparatus
in sleep to interpretation by the formation of illusions may evoke an incalculable
number of such attempts at interpretation. It may consequently be represented
in the dream- content by an extraordinary number of different concepts.
* But the theory of Strumpell and Wundt cannot point to any sort of motive
which controls the relation between the external stimulus and the dream-concept
chosen to interpret it, and therefore it cannot explain the "peculiar choice"
which the stimuli "often enough make in the course of their productive
activity" (Lipps, Grundtatsachen des Seelen-lebens, p. 170). Other objections
may be raised against the fundamental assumption behind the theory of illusions-
the assumption that during sleep the mind is not in a condition to recognize
the real nature of the objective sensory stimuli. The old physiologist
Burdach shows us that the mind is quite capable even during sleep of a
correct interpretation of the sensory impressions which reach it, and of
reacting in accordance with this correct interpretation, inasmuch as he
demonstrates that certain sensory impressions which seem important to the
individual may be excepted from the general neglect of the sleeping mind
(as in the example of nurse and child), and that one is more surely awakened
by one's own name than by an indifferent auditory impression; all of which
presupposes, of course, that the mind discriminates between sensations,
even in sleep. Burdach infers from these observations that we must not
assume that the mind is incapable of interpreting sensory stimuli in the
sleeping state, but rather that it is not sufficiently interested in them.
The arguments which Burdach employed in 1830 reappear unchanged in the
works of Lipps (in the year 1883), where they are employed for the purpose
of attacking the theory of somatic stimuli. According to these arguments
the mind seems to be like the sleeper in the anecdote, who, on being asked,
"Are you asleep?" answers "No," and on being again addressed with the words:
"Then lend me ten florins," takes refuge in the excuse: "I am asleep."

<P>&nbsp;* I would advise everyone to read the exact and detailed records
(collected in two volumes) of the dreams experimentally produced by Mourly
Vold in order to convince himself how little the conditions of the experiments
help to explain the content of the individual dream, and how little such
experiments help us towards an understanding of the problems of dreams.

<P>&nbsp;The inadequacy of the theory of somatic dream-stimuli may be further
demonstrated in another way. Observation shows that external stimuli do
not oblige me to dream, even though these stimuli appear in the dream-content
as soon as I begin to dream- supposing that I do dream. In response to
a touch or pressure stimulus experienced while I am asleep, a variety of
reactions are at my disposal. I may overlook it, and find on waking that
my leg has become uncovered, or that I have been lying on an arm; indeed,
pathology offers me a host of examples of powerfully exciting sensory and
motor stimuli of different kinds which remain ineffective during sleep.
I may perceive the sensation during sleep, and through my sleep, as it
were, as constantly happens in the case of pain stimuli, but without weaving
the pain into the texture of a dream. And thirdly, I may wake up in response
to the stimulus, simply in order to avoid it. Still another, fourth, reaction
is possible: namely, that the nervestimulus may cause me to dream; but
the other possible reactions occur quite as frequently as the reaction
of dream-formation. This, however, would not be the case if the incentive
to dreaming did not lie outside the somatic dream-sources.

<P>&nbsp;Appreciating the importance of the above-mentioned lacunae in
the explanation of dreams by somatic stimuli, other writers- Scherner,
for example, and, following him, the philosopher Volkelt- endeavoured to
determine more precisely the nature of the psychic activities which cause
the many-coloured images of our dreams to proceed from the somatic stimuli,
and in so doing they approached the problem of the essential nature of
dreams as a problem of psychology, and regarded dreaming as a psychic activity.
Scherner not only gave a poetical, vivid and glowing description of the
psychic peculiarities which unfold themselves in the course of dream-formation,
but he also believed that he had hit upon the principle of the method the
mind employs in dealing with the stimuli which are offered to it. The dream,
according to Scherner, in the free activity of the phantasy, which has
been released from the shackles imposed upon it during the day, strives
to represent symbolically the nature of the organ from which the stimulus
proceeds. Thus there exists a sort of dream-book, a guide to the interpretation
of dreams, by means of which bodily sensations, the conditions of the organs,
and states of stimulation, may be inferred from the dream-images. "Thus
the image of a cat expressed extreme ill-temper; the image of pale, smooth
pastry the nudity of the body. The human body as a whole is pictured by
the phantasy of the dream as a house, and the individual organs of the
body as parts of the house. In toothache-dreams a vaulted vestibule corresponds
to the mouth, and a staircase to the descent from the pharynx to the oesophagus;
in the headache-dream a ceiling covered with disgusting toad-like spiders
is chosen to denote the upper part of the head." "Many different symbols
are employed by our dreams for the same organ: thus the breathing lung
finds its symbol in a roaring stove, filled with flames, the heart in empty
boxes and baskets, and the bladder in round, bag-shaped or merely hollow
objects. It is of particular significance that at the close of the dream
the stimulating organ or its function is often represented without disguise
and usually on the dreamer's own body. Thus the toothache-dream commonly
ends by the dreamer drawing a tooth out of his mouth." It cannot be said
that this theory of dream-interpretation has found much favour with other
writers. It seems, above all, extravagant; and so Scherner's readers have
hesitated to give it even the small amount of credit to which it is, in
my opinion, entitled. As will be seen, it tends to a revival of dream-interpretation
by means of symbolism, a method employed by the ancients; only the province
from which the interpretation is to be derived is restricted to the human
body. The lack of a scientifically comprehensible technique of interpretation
must seriously limit the applicability of Scherner's theory. Arbitrariness
in the interpretation of dreams would appear to be by no means excluded,
especially since in this case also a stimulus may be expressed in the dream-content
by several representative symbols; thus even Scherner's follower Volkelt
was unable to confirm the representation of the body as a house. Another
objection is that here again the dream-activity is regarded as a useless
and aimless activity of the mind, since, according to this theory, the
mind is content with merely forming phantasies around the stimulus with
which it is dealing, without even remotely attempting to abolish the stimulus.

<P>&nbsp;Scherner's theory of the symbolization of bodily stimuli by the
dream is seriously damaged by yet another objection. These bodily stimuli
are present at all times, and it is generally assumed that the mind is
more accessible to them during sleep than in the waking state. It is therefore
impossible to understand why the mind does not dream continuously all night
long, and why it does not dream every night about all the organs. If one
attempts to evade this objection by positing the condition that special
excitations must proceed from the eye, the ear, the teeth, the bowels,
etc., in order to arouse the dream-activity, one is confronted with the
difficulty of proving that this increase of stimulation is objective; and
proof is possible only in a very few cases. If the dream of flying is a
symbolization of the upward and downward motion of the pulmonary lobes,
either this dream, as has already been remarked by Strumpell, should be
dreamt much oftener, or it should be possible to show that respiration
is more active during this dream. Yet a third alternative is possible-
and it is the most probable of all- namely, that now and again special
motives are operative to direct the attention to the visceral sensations
which are constantly present. But this would take us far beyond the scope
of Scherner's theory.

<P>&nbsp;The value of Scherner's and Volkelt's disquisitions resides in
their calling our attention to a number of characteristics of the dream-content
which are in need of explanation, and which seem to promise fresh discoveries.
It is quite true that symbolizations of the bodily organs and functions
do occur in dreams: for example, that water in a dream often signifies
a desire to urinate, that the male genital organ may be represented by
an upright staff, or a pillar, etc. With dreams which exhibit a very animated
field of vision and brilliant colours, in contrast to the dimness of other
dreams, the interpretation that they are "dreams due to visual stimulation"
can hardly be dismissed, nor can we dispute the participation of illusion-formation
in dreams which contain noise and a medley of voices. A dream like that
of Scherner's, that two rows of fair handsome boys stood facing one another
on a bridge, attacking one another, and then resuming their positions,
until finally the dreamer himself sat down on a bridge and drew a long
tooth from his jaw; or a similar dream of Volkelt's, in which two rows
of drawers played a part, and which again ended in the extraction of a
tooth; dream-formations of this kind, of which both writers relate a great
number, forbid our dismissing Scherner's theory as an idle invention without
seeking the kernel of truth which may be contained in it. We are therefore
confronted with the task of finding a different explanation of the supposed
symbolization of the alleged dental stimulus.

<P>&nbsp;Throughout our consideration of the theory of the somatic sources
of dreams, I have refrained from urging the argument which arises from
our analyses of dreams. If, by a procedure which has not been followed
by other writers in their investigation of dreams, we can prove that the
dream possesses intrinsic value as psychic action, that a wish supplies
the motive of its formation, and that the experiences of the previous day
furnish the most obvious material of its content, any other theory of dreams
which neglects such an important method of investigation- and accordingly
makes the dream appear a useless and enigmatical psychic reaction to somatic
stimuli- may be dismissed without special criticism. For in this case there
would have to be- and this is highly improbable- two entirely different
kinds of dreams, of which only one kind has come under our observation,
while the other kind alone has been observed by the earlier investigators.
It only remains now to find a place in our theory of dreams for the facts
on which the current doctrine of somatic dream-stimuli is based.

<P>&nbsp;We have already taken the first step in this direction in advancing
the thesis that the dream-work is under a compulsion to elaborate into
a unified whole all the dream-stimuli which are simultaneously present
(chapter V., A, above). We have seen that when two or more experiences
capable of making an impression on the mind have been left over from the
previous day, the wishes that result from them are united into one dream;
similarly, that the impressions possessing psychic value and the indifferent
experiences of the previous day unite in the dream-material, provided that
connecting ideas between the two can be established. Thus the dream appears
to be a reaction to everything which is simultaneously present as actual
in the sleeping mind. As far as we have hitherto analysed the dreammaterial,
we have discovered it to be a collection of psychic remnants and memory-traces,
which we were obliged to credit (on account of the preference shown for
recent and for infantile material) with a character of psychological actuality,
though the nature of this actuality was not at the time determinable. We
shall now have little difficulty in predicting what will happen when to
these actualities of the memory fresh material in the form of sensations
is added during sleep. These stimuli, again, are of importance to the dream
because they are actual; they are united with the other psychic actualities
to provide the material for dream-formation. To express it in other words,
the stimuli which occur during sleep are elaborated into a wish-fulfilment,
of which the other components are the psychic remnants of daily experience
with which we are already familiar. This combination, however, is not inevitable;
we have seen that more than one kind of behaviour toward the physical stimuli
received during sleep is possible. Where this combination is effected,
a conceptual material for the dream-content has been found which will represent
both kinds of dream-sources, the somatic as well as the psychic.

<P>&nbsp;The nature of the dream is not altered when somatic material is
added to the psychic dream-sources; it still remains a wish fulfilment,
no matter how its expression is determined by the actual material available.

<P>&nbsp;I should like to find room here for a number of peculiarities
which are able to modify the significance of external stimuli for the dream.
I imagine that a co-operation of individual, physiological and accidental
factors, which depend on the circumstances of the moment, determines how
one will behave in individual cases of more intensive objective stimulation
during sleep; habitual or accidental profundity of sleep, in conjunction
with the intensity of the stimulus, will in one case make it possible so
to suppress the stimulus that it will not disturb the sleeper, while in
another case it will force the sleeper to wake, or will assist the attempt
to subdue the stimulus by weaving it into the texture of the dream. In
accordance with the multiplicity of these constellations, external objective
stimuli will be expressed more rarely or more frequently in the case of
one person than in that of another. In my own case. since I am an excellent
sleeper, and obstinately refuse to allow myself to be disturbed during
sleep on any pretext whatever, this intrusion of external causes of excitation
into my dreams is very rare, whereas psychic motives apparently cause me
to dream very easily. Indeed, I have noted only a single dream in which
an objective, painful source of stimulation is demonstrable, and it will
be highly instructive to see what effect the external stimulus had in this
particular dream.

<P>&nbsp;I am riding a gray horse, at first timidly and awkwardly, as though
I were merely carried along. Then I meet a colleague, P, also on horseback,
and dressed in rough frieze; he is sitting erect in the saddle; he calls
my attention to something (probably to the fact that I have a very bad
seat). Now I begin to feel more and more at ease on the back of my highly
intelligent horse; I sit more comfortably, and I find that I am quite at
home up here. My saddle is a sort of pad, which completely fills the space
between the neck and the rump of the horse. I ride between two vans, and
just manage to clear them. After riding up the street for some distance,
I turn round and wish to dismount, at first in front of a little open chapel
which is built facing on to the street. Then I do really dismount in front
of a chapel which stands near the first one; the hotel is in the same street;
I might let the horse go there by itself, but I prefer to lead it thither.
It seems as though I should be ashamed to arrive there on horseback. In
front of the hotel there stands a page-boy, who shows me a note of mine
which has been found, and ridicules me on account of it. On the note is
written, doubly underlined, "Eat nothing," and then a second sentence (indistinct):
something like "Do not work"; at the same time a hazy idea that I am in
a strange city, in which I do not work.

<P>&nbsp;It will not at once be apparent that this dream originated under
the influence, or rather under the compulsion, of a painstimulus. The day
before, however, I had suffered from boils, which made every movement a
torture, and at last a boil had grown to the size of an apple at the root
of the scrotum, and had caused me the most intolerable pains at every step;
a feverish lassitude, lack of appetite, and the hard work which I had nevertheless
done during the day, had conspired with the pain to upset me. I was not
altogether in a condition to discharge my duties as a physician, but in
view of the nature and the location of the malady, it was possible to imagine
something else for which I was most of all unfit, namely riding. Now it
is this very activity of riding into which I am plunged by the dream; it
is the most energetic denial of the pain which imagination could conceive.
As a matter of fact, I cannot ride; I do not dream of doing so; I never
sat on a horse but once- and then without a saddle- and I did not like
it. But in this dream I ride as though I had no boil on the perineum; or
rather, I ride, just because I want to have none. To judge from the description,
my saddle is the poultice which has enabled me to fall asleep. Probably,
being thus comforted, I did not feel anything of my pain during the first
few hours of my sleep. Then the painful sensations made themselves felt,
and tried to wake me; whereupon the dream came and said to me, soothingly:
"Go on sleeping, you are not going to wake! You have no boil, for you are
riding on horseback, and with a boil just there no one could ride!" And
the dream was successful; the pain was stifled, and I went on sleeping.

<P>&nbsp;But the dream was not satisfied with "suggesting away" the boil
by tenaciously holding fast to an idea incompatible with the malady (thus
behaving like the hallucinatory insanity of a mother who has lost her child,
or of a merchant who has lost his fortune). In addition, the details of
the sensation denied and of the image used to suppress it serve the dream
also as a means to connect other material actually present in the mind
with the situation in the dream, and to give this material representation.
I am riding on a gray horse- the colour of the horse exactly corresponds
with the pepper-and-salt suit in which I last saw my colleague P in the
country. I have been warned that highly seasoned food is the cause of boils,
and in any case it is preferable as an aetiological explanation to sugar,
which might be thought of in connection with furunculosis. My friend P
likes to ride the high horse with me ever since he took my place in the
treatment of a female patient, in whose case I had performed great feats
(Kuntstucke: in the dream I sit the horse at first sideways, like a trick-rider,
Kunstreiter), but who really, like the horse in the story of the Sunday
equestrian, led me wherever she wished. Thus the horse comes to be a symbolic
representation of a lady patient (in the dream it is highly intelligent).
I feel quite at home refers to the position which I occupied in the patient's
household until I was replaced by my colleague P. "I thought you were safe
in the saddle up there," one of my few wellwishers among the eminent physicians
of the city recently said to me, with reference to the same household.
And it was a feat to practise psychotherapy for eight to ten hours a day,
while suffering such pain, but I know that I cannot continue my peculiarly
strenuous work for any length of time without perfect physical health,
and the dream is full of dismal allusions to the situation which would
result if my illness continued (the note, such as neurasthenics carry and
show to their doctors): Do not work, do not eat. On further interpretation
I see that the dream activity has succeeded in finding its way from the
wish-situation of riding to some very early childish quarrels which must
have occurred between myself and a nephew, who is a year older than I,
and is now living in England. It has also taken up elements from my journeys
in Italy: the street in the dream is built up out of impressions of Verona
and Siena. A still deeper interpretation leads to sexual dream-thoughts,
and I recall what the dream allusions to that beautiful country were supposed
to mean in the dream of a female patient who had never been to Italy (to
Italy, German: gen Italien = Genitalien = genitals); at the same time there
are references to the house in which I preceded my friend P as physician,
and to the place where the boil is located.

<P>&nbsp;In another dream, I was similarly successful in warding off a
threatened disturbance of my sleep; this time the threat came from a sensory
stimulus. It was only chance, however, that enabled me to discover the
connection between the dream and the accidental dream- stimulus, and in
this way to understand the dream. One midsummer morning in a Tyrolese mountain
resort I woke with the knowledge that I had dreamed: The Pope is dead.
I was not able to interpret this short, non-visual dream. I could remember
only one possible basis of the dream, namely, that shortly before this
the newspapers had reported that His Holiness was slightly indisposed.
But in the course of the morning my wife asked me: "Did you hear the dreadful
tolling of the church bells this morning?" I had no idea that I had heard
it, but now I understood my dream. It was the reaction of my need for sleep
to the noise by which the pious Tyroleans were trying to wake me. I avenged
myself on them by the conclusion which formed the content of my dream,
and continued to sleep, without any further interest in the tolling of
the bells.

<P>&nbsp;Among the dreams mentioned in the previous chapters there are
several which might serve as examples of the elaboration of so called nerve-stimuli.
The dream of drinking in long draughts is such an example; here the somatic
stimulus seems to be the sole source of the dream, and the wish arising
from the sensation- thirst- the only motive for dreaming. We find much
the same thing in other simple dreams, where the somatic stimulus is able
of itself to generate a wish. The dream of the sick woman who throws the
cooling apparatus from her cheek at night is an instance of an unusual
manner of reacting to a pain-stimulus with a wish fulfilment; it seems
as though the patient had temporarily succeeded in making herself analgesic,
and accompanied this by ascribing her pains to a stranger.

<P>&nbsp;My dream of the three Parcae is obviously a hunger-dream, but
it has contrived to shift the need for food right back to the child's longing
for its mother's breast, and to use a harmless desire as a mask for a more
serious one that cannot venture to express itself so openly. In the dream
of Count Thun we were able to see by what paths an accidental physical
need was brought into relation with the strongest, but also the most rigorously
repressed impulses of the psychic life. And when, as in the case reported
by Garnier, the First Consul incorporates the sound of an exploding infernal
machine into a dream of battle before it causes him to wake, the true purpose
for which alone psychic activity concerns itself with sensations during
sleep is revealed with unusual clarity. A young lawyer, who is full of
his first great bankruptcy case, and falls asleep in the afternoon, behaves
just as the great Napoleon did. He dreams of a certain G. Reich in Hussiatyn,
whose acquaintance he has made in connection with the bankruptcy case,
but Hussiatyn (German: husten, to cough) forces itself upon his attention
still further; he is obliged to wake, only to hear his wife- who is suffering
from bronchial catarrh- violently coughing.

<P>&nbsp;Let us compare the dream of Napoleon I- who, incidentally, was
an excellent sleeper- with that of the sleepy student, who was awakened
by his landlady with the reminder that he had to go to the hospital, and
who thereupon dreamt himself into a bed in the hospital, and then slept
on, the underlying reasoning being as follows: If I am already in the hospital,
I needn't get up to go there. This is obviously a convenience-dream; the
sleeper frankly admits to himself his motive in dreaming; but he thereby
reveals one of the secrets of dreaming in general. In a certain sense,
all dreams are convenience-dreams; they serve the purpose of continuing
to sleep instead of waking. The dream is the guardian of sleep, not its
disturber. In another place we shall have occasion to justify this conception
in respect to the psychic factors that make for waking; but we can already
demonstrate its applicability to the objective external stimuli. Either
the mind does not concern itself at all with the causes of sensations during
sleep, if it is able to carry this attitude through as against the intensity
of the stimuli, and their significance, of which it is well aware; or it
employs the dream to deny these stimuli; or, thirdly, if it is obliged
to recognize the stimuli, it seeks that interpretation of them which will
represent the actual sensation as a component of a desired situation which
is compatible with sleep. The actual sensation is woven into the dream
in order to deprive it of its reality. Napoleon is permitted to go on sleeping;
it is only a dream-memory of the thunder of the guns at Arcole which is
trying to disturb him. * -

<P>* The two sources from which I know of this dream do not entirely agree
as to its content. -

<P>&nbsp;The wish to sleep, to which the conscious ego has adjusted itself,
and which (together with the dream-censorship and the "secondary elaboration"
to be mentioned later) represents the ego's contribution to the dream,
must thus always be taken into account as a motive of dream-formation,
and every successful dream is a fulfilment of this wish. The relation of
this general, constantly present, and unvarying sleep-wish to the other
wishes of which now one and now another is fulfilled by the dreamcontent,
will be the subject of later consideration. In the wish to sleep we have
discovered a motive capable of supplying the deficiency in the theory of
Strumpell and Wundt, and of explaining the perversity and capriciousness
of the interpretation of the external stimulus. The correct interpretation,
of which the sleeping mind is perfectly capable, would involve active interest,
and would require the sleeper to wake; hence, of those interpretations
which are possible at all, only such are admitted as are acceptable to
the dictatorial censorship of the sleep-wish. The logic of dream situations
would run, for example: "It is the nightingale, and not the lark." For
if it is the lark, love's night is at an end. From among the interpretations
of the stimulus which are thus admissible, that one is selected which can
secure the best connection with the wish- impulses that are lying in wait
in the mind. Thus everything is definitely determined, and nothing is left
to caprice. The misinterpretation is not an illusion, but- if you will-
an excuse. Here again, as in substitution by displacement in the service
of the dream-censorship, we have an act of deflection of the normal psychic
procedure.

<P>&nbsp;If the external nerve-stimuli and the inner bodily stimuli are
sufficiently intense to compel psychic attention, they represent- that
is, if they result in dreaming at all, and not in waking- a fixed point
for dream-formation, a nucleus in the dream-material, for which an appropriate
wish-fulfilment is sought, just as (see above) mediating ideas between
two psychical dream-stimuli are sought. To this extent it is true of a
number of dreams that the somatic element dictates the dream-content. In
this extreme case even a wish that is not actually present may be aroused
for the purpose of dream-formation. But the dream cannot do otherwise than
represent a wish in some situation as fulfilled; it is, as it were, confronted
with the task of discovering what wish can be represented as fulfilled
by the given sensation. Even if this given material is of a painful or
disagreeable character, yet it is not unserviceable for the purposes of
dream-formation. The psychic life has at its disposal even wishes whose
fulfilment evokes displeasure, which seems a contradiction, but becomes
perfectly intelligible if we take into account the presence of two sorts
of psychic instance and the censorship that subsists between them.

<P>&nbsp;In the psychic life there exist, as we have seen, repressed wishes,
which belong to the first system, and to whose fulfilment the second system
is opposed. We do not mean this in a historic sense- that such wishes have
once existed and have subsequently been destroyed. The doctrine of repression,
which we need in the study of psychoneuroses, asserts that such repressed
wishes still exist, but simultaneously with an inhibition which weighs
them down. Language has hit upon the truth when it speaks of the suppression
(sub-pression, or pushing under) of such impulses. The psychic mechanism
which enables such suppressed wishes to force their way to realization
is retained in being and in working order. But if it happens that such
a suppressed wish is fulfilled, the vanquished inhibition of the second
system (which is capable of consciousness) is then expressed as discomfort.
And, in order to conclude this argument: If sensations of a disagreeable
character which originate from somatic sources are present during sleep,
this constellation is utilized by the dreamactivity to procure the fulfilment-
with more or less maintenance of the censorship- of an otherwise suppressed
wish.

<P>&nbsp;This state of affairs makes possible a certain number of anxiety
dreams, while others of these dream-formations which are unfavourable to
the wish-theory exhibit a different mechanism. For the anxiety in dreams
may of course be of a psychoneurotic character, originating in psycho-sexual
excitation, in which case, the anxiety corresponds to repressed libido.
Then this anxiety, like the whole anxiety-dream, has the significance of
a neurotic symptom, and we stand at the dividing-line where the wish- fulfilling
tendency of dreams is frustrated. But in other anxiety- dreams the feeling
of anxiety comes from somatic sources (as in the case of persons suffering
from pulmonary or cardiac trouble, with occasional difficulty in breathing),
and then it is used to help such strongly suppressed wishes to attain fulfilment
in a dream, the dreaming of which from psychic motives would have resulted
in the same release of anxiety. It is not difficult to reconcile these
two apparently contradictory cases. When two psychic formations, an affective
inclination and a conceptual content, are intimately connected, either
one being actually present will evoke the other, even in a dream; now the
anxiety of somatic origin evokes the suppressed conceptual content, now
it is the released conceptual content, accompanied by sexual excitement,
which causes the release of anxiety. In the one case, it may be said that
a somatically determined affect is psychically interpreted; in the other
case, all is of psychic origin, but the content which has been suppressed
is easily replaced by a somatic interpretation which fits the anxiety.
The difficulties which lie in the way of understanding all this have little
to do with dreams; they are due to the fact that in discussing these points
we are touching upon the problems of the development of anxiety and of
repression.

<P>&nbsp;The general aggregate of bodily sensation must undoubtedly be
included among the dominant dream-stimuli of internal bodily origin. Not
that it is capable of supplying the dream-content; but it forces the dream-thoughts
to make a choice from the material destined to serve the purpose of representation
in the dream- content, inasmuch as it brings within easy reach that part
of the material which is adapted to its own character, and holds the rest
at a distance. Moreover, this general feeling, which survives from the
preceding day, is of course connected with the psychic residues that are
significant for the dream. Moreover, this feeling itself may be either
maintained or overcome in the dream, so that it may, if it is painful,
veer round into its opposite.

<P>&nbsp;If the somatic sources of excitation during sleep- that is, the
sensations of sleep- are not of unusual intensity, the part which they
play in dream-formation is, in my judgment, similar to that of those impressions
of the day which are still recent, but of no great significance. I mean
that they are utilized for the dream formation if they are of such a kind
that they can be united with the conceptual content of the psychic dream-source,
but not otherwise. They are treated as a cheap ever-ready material, which
can be used whenever it is needed, and not as valuable material which itself
prescribes the manner in which it must be utilized. I might suggest the
analogy of a connoisseur giving an artist a rare stone, a piece of onyx,
for example, in order that it may be fashioned into a work of art. Here
the size of the stone, its colour, and its markings help to decide what
head or what scene shall be represented; while if he is dealing with a
uniform and abundant material such as marble or sandstone, the artist is
guided only by the idea which takes shape in his mind. Only in this way,
it seems to me, can we explain the fact that the dreamcontent furnished
by physical stimuli of somatic origin which are not unusually accentuated
does not make its appearance in all dreams and every night. * -

<P>&nbsp;* Rank has shown, in a number of studies, that certain awakening
dreams provoked by organic stimuli (dreams of urination and ejaculation)
are especially calculated to demonstrate the conflict between the need
for sleep and the demands of the organic need, as well as the influence
of the latter on the dreamcontent. -

<P>&nbsp;Perhaps an example which takes us back to the interpretation of
dreams will best illustrate my meaning. One day I was trying to understand
the significance of the sensation of being inhibited, of not being able
to move from the spot, of not being able to get something done, etc., which
occurs so frequently in dreams, and is so closely allied to anxiety. That
night I had the following dream: I am very incompletely dressed, and I
go from a flat on the ground- floor up a flight of stairs to an upper story.
In doing this I jump up three stairs at a time, and I am glad to find that
I can mount the stairs so quickly. Suddenly I notice that a servant-maid
is coming down the stairs- that is, towards me. I am ashamed, and try to
hurry away, and now comes this feeling of being inhibited; I am glued to
the stairs, and cannot move from the spot.

<P>&nbsp;Analysis: The situation of the dream is taken from an every-day
reality. In a house in Vienna I have two apartments, which are connected
only by the main staircase. My consultation-rooms and my study are on the
raised ground-floor, and my living-rooms are on the first floor. Late at
night, when I have finished my work downstairs, I go upstairs to my bedroom.
On the evening before the dream I had actually gone this short distance
with my garments in disarray- that is, I had taken off my collar, tie and
cuffs; but in the dream this had changed into a more advanced, but, as
usual, indefinite degree of undress. It is a habit of mine to run up two
or three steps at a time; moreover, there was a wish-fulfilment recognized
even in the dream, for the ease with which I run upstairs reassures me
as to the condition of my heart. Further, the manner in which I run upstairs
is an effective contrast to the sensation of being inhibited, which occurs
in the second half of the dream. It shows me- what needed no proof- that
dreams have no difficulty in representing motor actions fully and completely
carried out; think, for example, of flying in dreams!

<P>&nbsp;But the stairs up which I go are not those of my own house; at
first I do not recognize them; only the person coming towards me informs
me of their whereabouts. This woman is the maid of an old lady whom I visit
twice daily in order to give her hypodermic injections; the stairs, too,
are precisely similar to those which I have to climb twice a day in this
old lady's house.

<P>&nbsp;How do these stairs and this woman get into my dream? The shame
of not being fully dressed is undoubtedly of a sexual character; the servant
of whom I dream is older than I, surly, and by no means attractive. These
questions remind me of the following incident: When I pay my morning visit
at this house I am usually seized with a desire to clear my throat; the
sputum falls on the stairs. There is no spittoon on either of the two floors,
and I consider that the stairs should be kept clean not at my expense,
but rather by the provision of a spittoon. The housekeeper, another elderly,
curmudgeonly person, but, as I willingly admit, a woman of cleanly instincts,
takes a different view of the matter. She lies in wait for me, to see whether
I shall take the liberty referred to, and, if she sees that I do, I can
distinctly hear her growl. For days thereafter, when we meet she refuses
to greet me with the customary signs of respect. On the day before the
dream the housekeeper's attitude was reinforced by that of the maid. I
had just furnished my usual hurried visit to the patient when the servant
confronted me in the ante-room, observing: "You might as well have wiped
your shoes today, doctor, before you came into the room. The red carpet
is all dirty again from your feet." This is the only justification for
the appearance of the stairs and the maid in my dream.

<P>&nbsp;Between my leaping upstairs and my spitting on the stairs there
is an intimate connection. Pharyngitis and cardiac troubles are both supposed
to be punishments for the vice of smoking, on account of which vice my
own housekeeper does not credit me with excessive tidiness, so that my
reputation suffers in both the houses which my dream fuses into one.

<P>&nbsp;I must postpone the further interpretation of this dream until
I can indicate the origin of the typical dream of being incompletely clothed.
In the meantime, as a provisional deduction from the dream just related,
I note that the dream-sensation of inhibited movement is always aroused
at a point where a certain connection requires it. A peculiar condition
of my motor system during sleep cannot be responsible for this dream-content,
since a moment earlier I found myself, as though in confirmation of this
fact, skipping lightly up the stairs.
