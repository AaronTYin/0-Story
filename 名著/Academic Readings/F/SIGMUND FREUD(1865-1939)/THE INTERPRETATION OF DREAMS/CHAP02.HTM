<H3>
The Analysis of a Specimen Dream</H3>
THE epigraph on the title-page of this volume indicates the tradition to
which I prefer to ally myself in my conception of the dream. I am proposing
to show that dreams are capable of interpretation; and any contributions
to the solution of the problems which have already been discussed will
emerge only as possible by-products in the accomplishment of my special
task. On the hypothesis that dreams are susceptible of interpretation,
I at once find myself in disagreement with the prevailing doctrine of dreams-
in fact, with all the theories of dreams, excepting only that of Scherner,
for to interpret a dream is to specify its meaning, to replace it by something
which takes its position in the concatenation of our psychic activities
as a link of definite importance and value. But, as we have seen, the scientific
theories of the dream leave no room for a problem of dream- interpretation;
since, in the first place, according to these theories, dreaming is not
a psychic activity at all, but a somatic process which makes itself known
to the psychic apparatus by means of symbols. Lay opinion has always been
opposed to these theories. It asserts its privilege of proceeding illogically,
and although it admits that dreams are incomprehensible and absurd, it
cannot summon up the courage to deny that dreams have any significance.
Led by a dim intuition, it seems rather to assume that dreams have a meaning,
albeit a hidden one; that they are intended as a substitute for some other
thought-process, and that we have only to disclose this substitute correctly
in order to discover the hidden meaning of the dream.

<P>&nbsp;The unscientific world, therefore, has always endeavoured to interpret
dreams, and by applying one or the other of two essentially different methods.
The first of these methods envisages the dream-content as a whole, and
seeks to replace it by another content, which is intelligible and in certain
respects analogous. This is symbolic dream-interpretation; and of course
it goes to pieces at the very outset in the case of those dreams which
are not only unintelligible but confused. The construction which the biblical
Joseph placed upon the dream of Pharaoh furnishes an example of this method.
The seven fat kine, after which came seven lean ones that devoured the
former, were a symbolic substitute for seven years of famine in the land
of Egypt, which according to the prediction were to consume all the surplus
that seven fruitful years had produced. Most of the artificial dreams contrived
by the poets * are intended for some such symbolic interpretation, for
they reproduce the thought conceived by the poet in a guise not unlike
the disguise which we are wont to find in our dreams.

<P>* In a novel Gradiva, by the poet W. Jensen, I chanced to discover several
fictitious dreams, which were perfectly correct in their construction,
and could be interpreted as though they had not been invented, but had
been dreamt by actual persons. The poet declared, upon my inquiry, that
he was unacquainted with my theory of dreams. I have made use of this agreement
between my investigations and the creations of the poet as a proof of the
correctness of my method of dream-analysis (Der Wahn und die Traume in
W. Jenson's Gradiva, vol. i of the Schriften zur angewandten Seelenkunde,
1906, edited by myself, Ges. Schriften, vol. ix).

<P>The idea that the dream concerns itself chiefly with the future, whose
form it surmises in advance- a relic of the prophetic significance with
which dreams were once invested- now becomes the motive for translating
into the future the meaning of the dream which has been found by means
of symbolic interpretation.

<P>&nbsp;A demonstration of the manner in which one arrives at such a symbolic
interpretation cannot, of course, be given. Success remains a matter of
ingenious conjecture, of direct intuition, and for this reason dream-interpretation
has naturally been elevated into an art which seems to depend upon extraordinary
gifts. * The second of the two popular methods of dream- interpretation
entirely abandons such claims. It might be described as the cipher method,
since it treats the dream as a kind of secret code in which every sign
is translated into another sign of known meaning, according to an established
key. For example, I have dreamt of a letter, and also of a funeral or the
like; I consult a "dream-book," and I find that "letter" is to be translated
by "vexation" and "funeral" by "engagement." It now remains to establish
a connection, which I am again to assume as pertaining to the future, by
means of the rigmarole which I have deciphered. An interesting variant
of this cipher procedure, a variant in which its character of purely mechanical
transference is to a certain extent corrected, is presented in the work
on dream-interpretation by Artemidoros of Daldis. *(2) Here not only the
dream-content, but also the personality and social position of the dreamer
are taken into consideration, so that the same dream-content has a significance
for the rich man, the married man, or the orator, which is different from
that which applies to the poor man, the bachelor, or, let us say, the merchant.
The essential point, then, in this procedure is that the work of interpretation
is not applied to the entirety of the dream, but to each portion of the
dream-content severally, as though the dream were a conglomerate in which
each fragment calls for special treatment. Incoherent and confused dreams
are certainly those that have been responsible for the invention of the
cipher method. *(3)

<P>* Aristotle expressed himself in this connection by saying that the
best interpreter of dreams is he who can best grasp similarities. For dream-pictures,
like pictures in water, are disfigured by the motion (of the water), so
that he hits the target best who is able to recognize the true picture
in the distorted one (Buchsenschutz, p. 65).

<P>&nbsp;*(2) Artemidoros of Daldis, born probably in the beginning of
the second century of our calendar, has furnished us with the most complete
and careful elaboration of dream-interpretation as it existed in the Graeco-Roman
world. As Gompertz has emphasized, he ascribed great importance to the
consideration that dreams ought to be interpreted on the basis of observation
and experience, and he drew a definite line between his own art and other
methods, which he considered fraudulent. The principle of his art of interpretation
is, according to Gompertz, identical with that of magic: i.e., the principle
of association. The thing dreamed meant what it recalled to the memory-
to the memory, of course, of the dream-interpreter! This fact- that the
dream may remind the interpreter of various things, and every interpreter
of different things- leads, of course, to uncontrollable arbitrariness
and uncertainty. The technique which I am about to describe differs from
that of the ancients in one essential point, namely, in that it imposes
upon the dreamer himself the work of interpretation. Instead of taking
into account whatever may occur to the dream-interpreter, it considers
only what occurs to the dreamer in connection with the dream-element concerned.
According to the recent records of the missionary, Tfinkdjit (Anthropos,
1913), it would seem that the modern dream- interpreters of the Orient
likewise attribute much importance to the co-operation of the dreamer.
Of the dream-interpreters among the Mesopotamian Arabs this writer relates
as follows: "Pour interpreter exactement un songe les oniromanciens les
plus habiles s'informent de ceux qui les consultent de toutes les circonstances
qu'ils regardent necessaires pour la bonne explication.... En un mot, nos
oniromanciens ne laissent aucune circonstance leur echapper et ne donnent
l'interpretation desiree avant d'avoir parfaitement saisi et recu toutes
les interrogations desirables." [To interpret a dream exactly, the most
practised interpreters of dreams learn from those who consult them all
circumstances which they regard as necessary for a good explanation....
In a word, our interpreters allow no circumstance to be overlooked and
do not give the desired interpretation before perfectly taking and apprehending
all desirable questions.] Among these questions one always finds demands
for precise information in respect to near relatives (parents, wife, children)
as well as the following formula: habistine in hoc nocte copulam conjugalem
ante vel post somnium [Did you this night have conjugal copulation before
or after the dream?] "L'idee dominante dans l'interpretation des songes
consiste a expliquer le reve par son oppose." [The dominant idea in the
interpretation of dreams consists in explaining the dream by its opposite.]

<P>&nbsp;*(3) Dr. Alfred Robitsek calls my attention to the fact that Oriental
dream-books, of which ours are pitiful plagiarisms, commonly undertake
the interpretation of dream-elements in accordance with the assonance and
similarity of words. Since these relationships must be lost by translation
into our language, the incomprehensibility of the equivalents in our popular
"dream-books" is hereby explained. Information as to the extraordinary
significance of puns and the play upon words in the old Oriental cultures
may be found in the writings of Hugo Winckler. The finest example of a
dream-interpretation which has come down to us from antiquity is based
on a play upon words. Artemidoros relates the following (p. 225): "But
it seems to me that Aristandros gave a most happy interpretation to Alexander
of Macedon. When the latter held Tyros encompassed and in a state of siege,
and was angry and depressed over the great waste of time, he dreamed that
he saw a Satyr dancing on his shield. It happened that Aristandros was
in the neighbourhood of Tyros, and in the escort of the king, who was waging
war on the Syrians. By dividing the word Satyros into sa and turos, he
induced the king to become more aggressive in the siege. And thus Alexander
became master of the city." (Sa Turos = Thine is Tyros.) The dream, indeed,
is so intimately connected with verbal expression that Ferenczi justly
remarks that every tongue has its own dream- language. A dream is, as a
rule, not to be translated into other languages.

<P>The worthlessness of both these popular methods of interpretation does
not admit of discussion. As regards the scientific treatment of the subject,
the symbolic method is limited in its application, and is not susceptible
of a general exposition. In the cipher method everything depends upon whether
the key, the dream-book, is reliable, and for that all guarantees are lacking.
So that one might be tempted to grant the contention of the philosophers
and psychiatrists, and to dismiss the problem of dream-interpretation as
altogether fanciful. *

<P>* After the completion of my manuscript, a paper by Stumpf came to my
notice which agrees with my work in attempting to prove that the dream
is full of meaning and capable of interpretation. But the interpretation
is undertaken by means of an allegorizing symbolism, and there is no guarantee
that the procedure is generally applicable.

<P>I have, however, come to think differently. I have been forced to perceive
that here, once more, we have one of those not infrequent cases where an
ancient and stubbornly retained popular belief seems to have come nearer
to the truth of the matter than the opinion of modern science. I must insist
that the dream actually does possess a meaning, and that a scientific method
of dream-interpretation is possible. I arrived at my knowledge of this
method in the following manner:

<P>&nbsp;For years I have been occupied with the resolution of certain
psycho-pathological structures- hysterical phobias, obsessional ideas,
and the like- with therapeutic intentions. I have been so occupied, in
fact, ever since I heard the significant statement of Joseph Breuer, to
the effect that in these structures, regarded as morbid symptoms, solution
and treatment go hand in hand. * Where it has been possible to trace a
pathological idea back to those elements in the psychic life of the patient
to which it owed its origin, this idea has crumbled away, and the patient
has been relieved of it. In view of the failure of our other therapeutic
efforts, and in the face of the mysterious character of these pathological
conditions, it seemed to me tempting, in spite of all the difficulties,
to follow the method initiated by Breuer until a complete elucidation of
the subject had been achieved. I shall have occasion elsewhere to give
a detailed account of the form which the technique of this procedure has
finally assumed, and of the results of my efforts. In the course of these
psycho-analytic studies, I happened upon the question of dream-interpretation.
My patients, after I had pledged them to inform me of all the ideas and
thoughts which occurred to them in connection with a given theme, related
their dreams, and thus taught me that a dream may be interpolated in the
psychic concatenation, which may be followed backwards from a pathological
idea into the patient's memory. The next step was to treat the dream itself
as a symptom, and to apply to it the method of interpretation which had
been worked out for such symptoms.

<P>* Studien uber Hysterie, 1895. [Compare page 26 above.]

<P>For this a certain psychic preparation on the part of the patient is
necessary. A twofold effort is made, to stimulate his attentiveness in
respect of his psychic perceptions, and to eliminate the critical spirit
in which he is ordinarily in the habit of viewing such thoughts as come
to the surface. For the purpose of self-observation with concentrated attention
it is advantageous that the patient should take up a restful position and
close his eyes; he must be explicitly instructed to renounce all criticism
of the thought-formations which he may perceive. He must also be told that
the success of the psycho-analysis depends upon his noting and communicating
everything that passes through his mind, and that he must not allow himself
to suppress one idea because it seems to him unimportant or irrelevant
to the subject, or another because it seems nonsensical. He must preserve
an absolute impartiality in respect to his ideas; for if he is unsuccessful
in finding the desired solution of the dream, the obsessional idea, or
the like, it will be because he permits himself to be critical of them.

<P>&nbsp;I have noticed in the course of my psycho-analytical work that
the psychological state of a man in an attitude of reflection is entirely
different from that of a man who is observing his psychic processes. In
reflection there is a greater play of psychic activity than in the most
attentive self-observation; this is shown even by the tense attitude and
the wrinkled brow of the man in a state of reflection, as opposed to the
mimic tranquillity of the man observing himself. In both cases there must
be concentrated attention, but the reflective man makes use of his critical
faculties, with the result that he rejects some of the thoughts which rise
into consciousness after he has become aware of them, and abruptly interrupts
others, so that he does not follow the lines of thought which they would
otherwise open up for him; while in respect of yet other thoughts he is
able to behave in such a manner that they do not become conscious at all-
that is to say, they are suppressed before they are perceived. In self-observation,
on the other hand, he has but one task- that of suppressing criticism;
if he succeeds in doing this, an unlimited number of thoughts enter his
consciousness which would otherwise have eluded his grasp. With the aid
of the material thus obtained- material which is new to the self-observer-
it is possible to achieve the interpretation of pathological ideas, and
also that of dream-formations. As will be seen, the point is to induce
a psychic state which is in some degree analogous, as regards the distribution
of psychic energy (mobile attention), to the state of the mind before falling
asleep- and also, of course, to the hypnotic state. On falling asleep the
undesired ideas emerge, owing to the slackening of a certain arbitrary
(and, of course, also critical) action, which is allowed to influence the
trend of our ideas; we are accustomed to speak of fatigue as the reason
of this slackening; the emerging undesired ideas are changed into visual
and auditory images. In the condition which it utilized for the analysis
of dreams and pathological ideas, this activity is purposely and deliberately
renounced, and the psychic energy thus saved (or some part of it) is employed
in attentively tracking the undesired thoughts which now come to the surface-
thoughts which retain their identity as ideas (in which the condition differs
from the state of falling asleep). Undesired ideas are thus changed into
desired ones.

<P>&nbsp;There are many people who do not seem to find it easy to adopt
the required attitude toward the apparently "freely rising" ideas, and
to renounce the criticism which is otherwise applied to them. The "undesired
ideas" habitually evoke the most violent resistance, which seeks to prevent
them from coming to the surface. But if we may credit our great poet-philosopher
Friedrich Schiller, the essential condition of poetical creation includes
a very similar attitude. In a certain passage in his correspondence with
Korner (for the tracing of which we are indebted to Otto Rank), Schiller
replies in the following words to a friend who complains of his lack of
creative power: "The reason for your complaint lies, it seems to me, in
the constraint which your intellect imposes upon your imagination. Here
I will make an observation, and illustrate it by an allegory. Apparently
it is not good- and indeed it hinders the creative work of the mind- if
the intellect examines too closely the ideas already pouring in, as it
were, at the gates. Regarded in isolation, an idea may be quite insignificant,
and venturesome in the extreme, but it may acquire importance from an idea
which follows it; perhaps, in a certain collocation with other ideas, which
may seem equally absurd, it may be capable of furnishing a very serviceable
link. The intellect cannot judge all these ideas unless it can retain them
until it has considered them in connection with these other ideas. In the
case of a creative mind, it seems to me, the intellect has withdrawn its
watchers from the gates, and the ideas rush in pell-mell, and only then
does it review and inspect the multitude. You worthy critics, or whatever
you may call yourselves, are ashamed or afraid of the momentary and passing
madness which is found in all real creators, the longer or shorter duration
of which distinguishes the thinking artist from the dreamer. Hence your
complaints of unfruitfulness, for you reject too soon and discriminate
too severely" (letter of December 1, 1788).

<P>&nbsp;And yet, such a withdrawal of the watchers from the gates of the
intellect, as Schiller puts it, such a translation into the condition of
uncritical self-observation, is by no means difficult.

<P>&nbsp;Most of my patients accomplish it after my first instructions.
I myself can do so very completely, if I assist the process by writing
down the ideas that flash through my mind. The quantum of psychic energy
by which the critical activity is thus reduced, and by which the intensity
of self-observation may be increased, varies considerably according to
the subject-matter upon which the attention is to be fixed.

<P>&nbsp;The first step in the application of this procedure teaches us
that one cannot make the dream as a whole the object of one's attention,
but only the individual components of its content. If I ask a patient who
is as yet unpractised: "What occurs to you in connection with this dream?"
he is unable, as a rule, to fix upon anything in his psychic field of vision.
I must first dissect the dream for him; then, in connection with each fragment,
he gives me a number of ideas which may be described as the thoughts behind
this part of the dream. In this first and important condition, then, the
method of dream-interpretation which I employ diverges from the popular,
historical and legendary method of interpretation by symbolism and approaches
more nearly to the second or cipher method. Like this, it is an interpretation
in detail, not en masse; like this, it conceives the dream, from the outset,
as something built up, as a conglomerate of psychic formations.

<P>&nbsp;In the course of my psycho-analysis of neurotics I have already
subjected perhaps more than a thousand dreams to interpretation, but I
do not wish to use this material now as an introduction to the theory and
technique of dream-interpretation. For quite apart from the fact that I
should lay myself open to the objection that these are the dreams of neuropaths,
so that the conclusions drawn from them would not apply to the dreams of
healthy persons, there is another reason that impels me to reject them.
The theme to which these dreams point is, of course, always the history
of the malady that is responsible for the neurosis. Hence every dream would
require a very long introduction, and an investigation of the nature and
aetiological conditions of the psychoneuroses, matters which are in themselves
novel and exceedingly strange, and which would therefore distract attention
from the dream- problem proper. My purpose is rather to prepare the way,
by the solution of the dream-problem, for the solution of the more difficult
problems of the psychology of the neuroses. But if I eliminate the dreams
of neurotics, which constitute my principal material, I cannot be too fastidious
in my treatment of the rest. Only those dreams are left which have been
incidentally related to me by healthy persons of my acquaintance, or which
I find given as examples in the literature of dream-life. Unfortunately,
in all these dreams I am deprived of the analysis without which I cannot
find the meaning of the dream. My mode of procedure is, of course, less
easy than that of the popular cipher method, which translates the given
dream-content by reference to an established key; I, on the contrary, hold
that the same dream-content may conceal a different meaning in the case
of different persons, or in different connections. I must, therefore, resort
to my own dreams as a source of abundant and convenient material, furnished
by a person who is more or less normal, and containing references to many
incidents of everyday life. I shall certainly be confronted with doubts
as to the trustworthiness of these self- analyses and it will be said that
arbitrariness is by no means excluded in such analyses. In my own judgment,
conditions are more likely to be favourable in self-observation than in
the observation of others; in any case, it is permissible to investigate
how much can be accomplished in the matter of dream- interpretation by
means of self-analysis. There are other difficulties which must be overcome
in my own inner self. One has a comprehensible aversion to exposing so
many intimate details of one's own psychic life, and one does not feel
secure against the misinterpretations of strangers. But one must be able
to transcend such considerations. "Tout psychologiste," writes Delboeuf,
"est oblige de faire l'aveu meme de ses faiblesses s'il croit par la jeter
du jour sur quelque probleme obscur." * And I may assume for the reader
that his initial interest in the indiscretions which I must commit will
very soon give way to an exclusive engrossment in the psychological problems
elucidated by them.' *(2)

<P>* Every psychologist is obliged to admit even his own weaknesses, if
he thinks by that he may throw light on a difficult problem.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) However, I will not omit to mention, in qualification of
the above statement, that I have practically never reported a complete
interpretation of a dream of my own. And I was probably right not to trust
too far to the reader's discretion.

<P>I shall therefore select one of my own dreams for the purpose of elucidating
my method of interpretation. Every such dream necessitates a preliminary
statement; so that I must now beg the reader to make my interests his own
for a time, and to become absorbed, with me, in the most trifling details
of my life; for an interest in the hidden significance of dreams imperatively
demands just such a transference.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT</H3>
In the summer of 1895 I had treated psycho-analytically a young lady who
was an intimate friend of mine and of my family. It will be understood
that such complicated relations may excite manifold feelings in the physician,
and especially the psychotherapist. The personal interest of the physician
is greater, but his authority less. If he fails, his friendship with the
patient's relatives is in danger of being undermined. In this case, however,
the treatment ended in partial success; the patient was cured of her hysterical
anxiety, but not of all her somatic symptoms. At that time I was not yet
quite sure of the criteria which denote the final cure of an hysterical
case, and I expected her to accept a solution which did not seem acceptable
to her. In the midst of this disagreement, we discontinued the treatment
for the summer holidays. One day a younger colleague, one of my most intimate
friends, who had visited the patient- Irma- and her family in their country
residence, called upon me. I asked him how Irma was, and received the reply:
"She is better, but not quite well." I realize that these words of my friend
Otto's, or the tone of voice in which they were spoken, annoyed me. I thought
I heard a reproach in the words, perhaps to the effect that I had promised
the patient too much, and- rightly or wrongly- I attributed Otto's apparent
taking sides against me to the influence of the patient's relatives, who,
I assumed, had never approved of my treatment. This disagreeable impression,
however, did not become clear to me, nor did I speak of it. That same evening
I wrote the clinical history of Irma's case, in order to give it, as though
to justify myself, to Dr. M, a mutual friend, who was at that time the
leading personality in our circle. During the night (or rather in the early
morning) I had the following dream, which I recorded immediately after
waking. * -

<P>* This is the first dream which I subjected to an exhaustive interpretation.
<H4>
DREAM OF JULY 23- 24, 1895</H4>
A great hall- a number of guests, whom we are receiving- among them Irma,
whom I immediately take aside, as though to answer her letter, and to reproach
her for not yet accepting the "solution." I say to her: "If you still have
pains, it is really only your own fault."- She answers: "If you only knew
what pains I have now in the throat, stomach, and abdomen- I am choked
by them." I am startled, and look at her. She looks pale and puffy. I think
that after all I must be overlooking some organic affection. I take her
to the window and look into her throat. She offers some resistance to this,
like a woman who has a set of false teeth. I think, surely, she doesn't
need them.- The mouth then opens wide, and I find a large white spot on
the right, and elsewhere I see extensive grayish-white scabs adhering to
curiously curled formations, which are evidently shaped like the turbinal
bones of the nose.- I quickly call Dr. M, who repeats the examination and
confirms it.... Dr. M looks quite unlike his usual self; he is very pale,
he limps, and his chin is clean-shaven.... Now my friend Otto, too, is
standing beside her, and my friend Leopold percusses her covered chest,
and says "She has a dullness below, on the left," and also calls attention
to an infiltrated portion of skin on the left shoulder (which I can feel,
in spite of the dress).... M says: "There's no doubt that it's an infection,
but it doesn't matter; dysentery will follow and the poison will be eliminated."
... We know, too, precisely how the infection originated. My friend Otto,
not long ago, gave her, when she was feeling unwell, an injection of a
preparation of propyl... propyls... propionic acid... trimethylamin (the
formula of which I see before me, printed in heavy type).... One doesn't
give such injections so rashly.... Probably, too, the syringe was not clean.

<P>This dream has an advantage over many others. It is at once obvious
to what events of the preceding day it is related, and of what subject
it treats. The preliminary statement explains these matters. The news of
Irma's health which I had received from Otto, and the clinical history,
which I was writing late into the night, had occupied my psychic activities
even during sleep. Nevertheless, no one who had read the preliminary report,
and had knowledge of the content of the dream, could guess what the dream
signified. Nor do I myself know. I am puzzled by the morbid symptoms of
which Irma complains in the dream, for they are not the symptoms for which
I treated her. I smile at the nonsensical idea of an injection of propionic
acid, and at Dr. M's attempt at consolation. Towards the end the dream
seems more obscure and quicker in tempo than at the beginning. In order
to learn the significance of all these details I resolve to undertake an
exhaustive analysis.
<H4>
Analysis</H4>
The hall- a number of guests, whom we are receiving. We were living that
summer at Bellevue, an isolated house on one of the hills adjoining the
Kahlenberg. This house was originally built as a place of entertainment,
and therefore has unusually lofty, hall-like rooms. The dream was dreamed
in Bellevue, a few days before my wife's birthday. During the day my wife
had mentioned that she expected several friends, and among them Irma, to
come to us as guests for her birthday. My dream, then, anticipates this
situation: It is my wife's birthday, and we are receiving a number of people,
among them Irma, as guests in the large hall of Bellevue.

<P>&nbsp;I reproach Irma for not having accepted the "solution." I say,
"If you still have pains, it is really your own fault." I might even have
said this while awake; I may have actually said it. At that time I was
of the opinion (recognized later to be incorrect) that my task was limited
to informing patients of the hidden meaning of their symptoms. Whether
they then accepted or did not accept the solution upon which success depended-
for that I was not responsible. I am grateful to this error, which, fortunately,
has now been overcome, since it made life easier for me at a time when,
with all my unavoidable ignorance, I was expected to effect successful
cures. But I note that, in the speech which I make to Irma in the dream,
I am above all anxious that I shall not be blamed for the pains which she
still suffers. If it is Irma's own fault, it cannot be mine. Should the
purpose of the dream be looked for in this quarter?

<P>&nbsp;Irma's complaints- pains in the neck, abdomen, and stomach; she
is choked by them. Pains in the stomach belonged to the symptom- complex
of my patient, but they were not very prominent; she complained rather
of qualms and a feeling of nausea. Pains in the neck and abdomen and constriction
of the throat played hardly any part in her case. I wonder why I have decided
upon this choice of symptoms in the dream; for the moment I cannot discover
the reason.

<P>&nbsp;She looks pale and puffy. My patient had always a rosy complexion.
I suspect that here another person is being substituted for her.

<P>&nbsp;I am startled at the idea that I may have overlooked some organic
affection. This, as the reader will readily believe, is a constant fear
with the specialist who sees neurotics almost exclusively, and who is accustomed
to ascribe to hysteria so many manifestations which other physicians treat
as organic. On the other hand, I am haunted by a faint doubt- I do not
know whence it comes- whether my alarm is altogether honest. If Irma's
pains are indeed of organic origin, it is not my duty to cure them. My
treatment, of course, removes only hysterical pains. It seems to me, in
fact, that I wish to find an error in the diagnosis; for then I could not
be reproached with failure to effect a cure.

<P>&nbsp;I take her to the window in order to look into her throat. She
resists a little, like a woman who has false teeth. I think to myself,
she does not need them. I had never had occasion to inspect Irma's oral
cavity. The incident in the dream reminds me of an examination, made some
time before, of a governess who at first produced an impression of youthful
beauty, but who, upon opening her mouth, took certain measures to conceal
her denture. Other memories of medical examinations, and of petty secrets
revealed by them, to the embarrassment of both physician and patient, associate
themselves with this case.- "She surely does not need them," is perhaps
in the first place a compliment to Irma; but I suspect yet another meaning.
In a careful analysis one is able to feel whether or not the arriere-pensees
which are to be expected have all been exhausted. The way in which Irma
stands at the window suddenly reminds me of another experience. Irma has
an intimate woman friend of whom I think very highly. One evening, on paying
her a visit, I found her at the window in the position reproduced in the
dream, and her physician, the same Dr. M, declared that she had a diphtheritic
membrane. The person of Dr. M and the membrane return, indeed, in the course
of the dream. Now it occurs to me that during the past few months I have
had every reason to suppose that this lady too is hysterical. Yes, Irma
herself betrayed the fact to me. But what do I know of her condition? Only
the one thing, that like Irma in the dream she suffers from hysterical
choking. Thus, in the dream I have replaced my patient by her friend. Now
I remember that I have often played with the supposition that this lady,
too, might ask me to relieve her of her symptoms. But even at the time
I thought it improbable, since she is extremely reserved. She resists,
as the dream shows. Another explanation might be that she does not need
it; in fact, until now she has shown herself strong enough to master her
condition without outside help. Now only a few features remain, which I
can assign neither to Irma nor to her friend; pale, puffy, false teeth.
The false teeth led me to the governess; I now feel inclined to be satisfied
with bad teeth. Here another person, to whom these features may allude,
occurs to me. She is not my patient, and I do not wish her to be my patient,
for I have noticed that she is not at her ease with me, and I do not consider
her a docile patient. She is generally pale, and once, when she had not
felt particularly well, she was puffy. * I have thus compared my patient
Irma with two others, who would likewise resist treatment. What is the
meaning of the fact that I have exchanged her for her friend in the dream?
Perhaps that I wish to exchange her; either her friend arouses in me stronger
sympathies, or I have a higher regard for her intelligence. For I consider
Irma foolish because she does not accept my solution. The other woman would
be more sensible, and would thus be more likely to yield. The mouth then
opens readily; she would tell more than Irma. *(2)

<P>* The complaint of pains in the abdomen, as yet unexplained, may also
be referred to this third person. It is my own wife, of course, who is
in question; the abdominal pains remind me of one of the occasions on which
her shyness became evident to me. I must admit that I do not treat Irma
and my wife very gallantly in this dream, but let it be said, in my defence,
that I am measuring both of them against the ideal of the courageous and
docile female patient.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) I suspect that the interpretation of this portion has not
been carried far enough to follow every hidden meaning. If I were to continue
the comparison of the three women, I should go far afield. Every dream
has at least one point at which it is unfathomable: a central point, as
it were, connecting it with the unknown.

<P>What I see in the throat: a white spot and scabby turbinal bones. The
white spot recalls diphtheria, and thus Irma's friend, but it also recalls
the grave illness of my eldest daughter two years earlier, and all the
anxiety of that unhappy time. The scab on the turbinal bones reminds me
of my anxiety concerning my own health. At that time I frequently used
cocaine in order to suppress distressing swellings in the nose, and I had
heard a few days previously that a lady patient who did likewise had contracted
an extensive necrosis of the nasal mucous membrane. In 1885 it was I who
had recommended the use of cocaine, and I had been gravely reproached in
consequence. A dear friend, who had died before the date of this dream,
had hastened his end by the misuse of this remedy.

<P>&nbsp;I quickly call Dr. M, who repeats the examination. This would
simply correspond to the position which M occupied among us. But the word
quickly is striking enough to demand a special examination. It reminds
me of a sad medical experience. By continually prescribing a drug (sulphonal),
which at that time was still considered harmless, I was once responsible
for a condition of acute poisoning in the case of a woman patient, and
hastily turned for assistance to my older and more experienced colleague.
The fact that I really had this case in mind is confirmed by a subsidiary
circumstance. The patient, who succumbed to the toxic effects of the drug,
bore the same name as my eldest daughter. I had never thought of this until
now; but now it seems to me almost like a retribution of fate- as though
the substitution of persons had to be continued in another sense: this
Matilda for that Matilda; an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. It is
as though I were seeking every opportunity to reproach myself for a lack
of medical conscientiousness.

<P>&nbsp;Dr. M is pale; his chin is shaven, and he limps. Of this so much
is correct, that his unhealthy appearance often arouses the concern of
his friends. The other two characteristics must belong to another person.
An elder brother living abroad occurs to me, for he, too, shaves his chin,
and if I remember him rightly, the M of the dream bears on the whole a
certain resemblance to him. And some days previously the news arrived that
he was limping on account of an arthritic affection of the hip. There must
be some reason why I fuse the two persons into one in my dream. I remember
that, in fact, I was on bad terms with both of them for similar reasons.
Both had rejected a certain proposal which I had recently made them.

<P>&nbsp;My friend Otto is now standing next to the patient, and my friend
Leopold examines her and calls attention to a dulness low down on the left
side. My friend Leopold also is a physician, and a relative of Otto's.
Since the two practice the same specialty, fate has made them competitors,
so that they are constantly being compared with one another. Both of them
assisted me for years, while I was still directing a public clinic for
neurotic children. There, scenes like that reproduced in my dream had often
taken place. While I would be discussing the diagnosis of a case with Otto,
Leopold would examine the child anew and make an unexpected contribution
towards our decision. There was a difference of character between the two
men like that between Inspector Brasig and his friend Karl. Otto was remarkably
prompt and alert; Leopold was slow and thoughtful, but thorough. If I contrast
Otto and the cautious Leopold in the dream I do so, apparently, in order
to extol Leopold. The comparison is like that made above between the disobedient
patient Irma and her friend, who was believed to be more sensible. I now
become aware of one of the tracks along which the association of ideas
in the dream proceeds: from the sick child to the children's clinic. Concerning
the dulness low on the left side, I have the impression that it corresponds
with a certain case of which all the details were similar, a case in which
Leopold impressed me by his thoroughness. I thought vaguely, too, of something
like a metastatic affection, but it might also be a reference to the patient
whom I should have liked to have in Irma's place. For this lady, as far
as I can gather, exhibited symptoms which imitated tuberculosis.

<P>&nbsp;An infiltrated portion of skin on the left shoulder. I know at
once that this is my own rheumatism of the shoulder, which I always feel
if I lie awake long at night. The very phrasing of the dream sounds ambiguous:
Something which I can feel, as he does, in spite of the dress. "Feel on
my own body" is intended. Further, it occurs to me how unusual the phrase
infiltrated portion of skin sounds. We are accustomed to the phrase: "an
infiltration of the upper posterior left"; this would refer to the lungs,
and thus, once more, to tuberculosis.

<P>&nbsp;In spite of the dress. This, to be sure, is only an interpolation.
At the clinic the children were, of course, examined undressed; here we
have some contrast to the manner in which adult female patients have to
be examined. The story used to be told of an eminent physician that he
always examined his patients through their clothes. The rest is obscure
to me; I have, frankly, no inclination to follow the matter further.

<P>&nbsp;Dr. M says: "It's an infection, but it doesn't matter; dysentery
will follow, and the poison will be eliminated." This, at first, seems
to me ridiculous; nevertheless, like everything else, it must be carefully
analysed; more closely observed it seems after all to have a sort of meaning.
What I had found in the patient was a local diphtheritis. I remember the
discussion about diphtheritis and diphtheria at the time of my daughter's
illness. Diphtheria is the general infection which proceeds from local
diphtheritis. Leopold demonstrates the existence of such a general infection
by the dulness, which also suggests a metastatic focus. I believe, however,
that just this kind of metastasis does not occur in the case of diphtheria.
It reminds me rather of pyaemia.

<P>&nbsp;It doesn't matter is a consolation. I believe it fits in as follows:
The last part of the dream has yielded a content to the effect that the
patient's sufferings are the result of a serious organic affection. I begin
to suspect that by this I am only trying to shift the blame from myself.
Psychic treatment cannot be held responsible for the continued presence
of a diphtheritic affection. Now, indeed, I am distressed by the thought
of having invented such a serious illness for Irma, for the sole purpose
of exculpating myself. It seems so cruel. Accordingly, I need the assurance
that the outcome will be benign, and it seems to me that I made a good
choice when I put the words that consoled me into the mouth of Dr. M. But
here I am placing myself in a position of superiority to the dream; a fact
which needs explanation.

<P>&nbsp;But why is this consolation so nonsensical?

<P>&nbsp;Dysentery. Some sort of far-fetched theoretical notion that the
toxins of disease might be eliminated through the intestines. Am I thereby
trying to make fun of Dr. M's remarkable store of far- fetched explanations,
his habit of conceiving curious pathological relations? Dysentery suggests
something else. A few months ago I had in my care a young man who was suffering
from remarkable intestinal troubles; a case which had been treated by other
colleagues as one of "anaemia with malnutrition." I realized that it was
a case of hysteria; I was unwilling to use my psycho-therapy on him, and
sent him off on a sea-voyage. Now a few days previously I had received
a despairing letter from him; he wrote from Egypt, saying that he had had
a fresh attack, which the doctor had declared to be dysentery. I suspect
that the diagnosis is merely an error on the part of an ignorant colleague,
who is allowing himself to be fooled by the hysteria; yet I cannot help
reproaching myself for putting the invalid in a position where he might
contract some organic affection of the bowels in addition to his hysteria.
Furthermore, dysentery sounds not unlike diphtheria, a word which does
not occur in the dream.

<P>&nbsp;Yes, it must be the case that with the consoling prognosis, Dysentery
will develop, etc., I am making fun of Dr. M, for I recollect that years
ago he once jestingly told a very similar story of a colleague. He had
been called in to consult with him in the case of a woman who was very
seriously ill, and he felt obliged to confront his colleague, who seemed
very hopeful, with the fact that he found albumen in the patient's urine.
His colleague, however, did not allow this to worry him, but answered calmly:
"That does not matter, my dear sir; the albumen will soon be excreted!"
Thus I can no longer doubt that this part of the dream expresses derision
for those of my colleagues who are ignorant of hysteria. And, as though
in confirmation, the thought enters my mind: "Does Dr. M know that the
appearances in Irma's friend, his patient, which gave him reason to fear
tuberculosis, are likewise due to hysteria? Has he recognized this hysteria,
or has he allowed himself to be fooled?"

<P>&nbsp;But what can be my motive in treating this friend so badly? That
is simple enough: Dr. M agrees with my solution as little as does Irma
herself. Thus, in this dream I have already revenged myself on two persons:
on Irma in the words, If you still have pains, it is your own fault, and
on Dr. M in the wording of the nonsensical consolation which has been put
into his mouth.

<P>&nbsp;We know precisely how the infection originated. This precise knowledge
in the dream is remarkable. Only a moment before this we did not yet know
of the infection, since it was first demonstrated by Leopold.

<P>&nbsp;My friend Otto gave her an injection not long ago, when she was
feeling unwell. Otto had actually related during his short visit to Irma's
family that he had been called in to a neighbouring hotel in order to give
an injection to someone who had been suddenly taken ill. Injections remind
me once more of the unfortunate friend who poisoned himself with cocaine.
I had recommended the remedy for internal use only during the withdrawal
of morphia; but he immediately gave himself injections of cocaine.

<P>&nbsp;With a preparation of propyl... propyls... propionic acid. How
on earth did this occur to me? On the evening of the day after I had written
the clinical history and dreamed about the case, my wife opened a bottle
of liqueur labelled "Ananas," * which was a present from our friend Otto.
He had, as a matter of fact, a habit of making presents on every possible
occasion; I hope he will some day be cured of this by a wife. *(2) This
liqueur smelt so strongly of fusel oil that I refused to drink it. My wife
suggested: "We will give the bottle to the servants," and I, more prudent,
objected, with the philanthropic remark: "They shan't be poisoned either."
The smell of fusel oil (amyl...) has now apparently awakened my memory
of the whole series: propyl, methyl, etc., which furnished the preparation
of propyl mentioned in the dream. Here, indeed, I have effected a substitution:
I dreamt of propyl after smelling amyl; but substitutions of this kind
are perhaps permissible, especially in organic chemistry. -

<P>* "Ananas," moreover, has a remarkable assonance with the family name
of my patient Irma.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) In this the dream did not turn out to be prophetic. But in
another sense it proved correct, for the "unsolved" stomach pains, for
which I did not want to be blamed, were the forerunners of a serious illness,
due to gall-stones.

<P>Trimethylamin. In the dream I see the chemical formula of this substance-
which at all events is evidence of a great effort on the part of my memory-
and the formula is even printed in heavy type, as though to distinguish
it from the context as something of particular importance. And where does
trimethylamin, thus forced on my attention, lead me? To a conversation
with another friend, who for years has been familiar with all my germinating
ideas, and I with his. At that time he had just informed me of certain
ideas concerning a sexual chemistry, and had mentioned, among others, that
he thought he had found in trimethylamin one of the products of sexual
metabolism. This substance thus leads me to sexuality, the factor to which
I attribute the greatest significance in respect of the origin of these
nervous affections which I am trying to cure. My patient Irma is a young
widow; if I am required to excuse my failure to cure her, I shall perhaps
do best to refer to this condition, which her admirers would be glad to
terminate. But in what a singular fashion such a dream is fitted together!
The friend who in my dream becomes my patient in Irma's place is likewise
a young widow.

<P>&nbsp;I surmise why it is that the formula of trimethylamin is so insistent
in the dream. So many important things are centered about this one word:
trimethylamin is an allusion, not merely to the all-important factor of
sexuality, but also to a friend whose sympathy I remember with satisfaction
whenever I feel isolated in my opinions. And this friend, who plays such
a large part in my life: will he not appear yet again in the concatenation
of ideas peculiar to this dream? Of course; he has a special knowledge
of the results of affections of the nose and the sinuses, and has revealed
to science several highly remarkable relations between the turbinal bones
and the female sexual organs. (The three curly formations in Irma's throat.)
I got him to examine Irma, in order to determine whether her gastric pains
were of nasal origin. But he himself suffers from suppurative rhinitis,
which gives me concern, and to this perhaps there is an allusion in pyaemia,
which hovers before me in the metastasis of the dream.

<P>&nbsp;One doesn't give such injections so rashly. Here the reproach
of rashness is hurled directly at my friend Otto. I believe I had some
such thought in the afternoon, when he seemed to indicate, by word and
look, that he had taken sides against me. It was, perhaps: "How easily
he is influenced; how irresponsibly he pronounces judgment." Further, the
above sentence points once more to my deceased friend, who so irresponsibly
resorted to cocaine injections. As I have said, I had not intended that
injections of the drug should be taken. I note that in reproaching Otto
I once more touch upon the story of the unfortunate Matilda, which was
the pretext for the same reproach against me. Here, obviously, I am collecting
examples of my conscientiousness, and also of the reverse.

<P>&nbsp;Probably too the syringe was not clean. Another reproach directed
at Otto, but originating elsewhere. On the previous day I happened to meet
the son of an old lady of eighty-two, to whom I am obliged to give two
injections of morphia daily. At present she is in the country, and I have
heard that she is suffering from phlebitis. I immediately thought that
this might be a case of infiltration caused by a dirty syringe. It is my
pride that in two years I have not given her a single infiltration; I am
always careful, of course, to see that the syringe is perfectly clean.
For I am conscientious. From the phlebitis I return to my wife, who once
suffered from thrombosis during a period of pregnancy, and now three related
situations come to the surface in my memory, involving my wife, Irma, and
the dead Matilda, whose identity has apparently justified my putting these
three persons in one another's places.

<P>&nbsp;I have now completed the interpretation of the dream. * In the
course of this interpretation I have taken great pains to avoid all those
notions which must have been suggested by a comparison of the dream-content
with the dream-thoughts hidden behind this content. Meanwhile the meaning
of the dream has dawned upon me. I have noted an intention which is realized
through the dream, and which must have been my motive in dreaming. The
dream fulfills several wishes, which were awakened within me by the events
of the previous evening (Otto's news, and the writing of the clinical history).
For the result of the dream is that it is not I who am to blame for the
pain which Irma is still suffering, but that Otto is to blame for it. Now
Otto has annoyed me by his remark about Irma's imperfect cure; the dream
avenges me upon him, in that it turns the reproach upon himself. The dream
acquits me of responsibility for Irma's condition, as it refers this condition
to other causes (which do, indeed, furnish quite a number of explanations).
The dream represents a certain state of affairs, such as I might wish to
exist; the content of the dream is thus the fulfilment of a wish; its motive
is a wish.

<P>* Even if I have not, as might be expected, accounted for everything
that occurred to me in connection with the work of interpretation.

<P>This much is apparent at first sight. But many other details of the
dream become intelligible when regarded from the standpoint of wish-fulfilment.
I take my revenge on Otto, not merely for too readily taking sides against
me. in that I accuse him of careless medical treatment (the injection),
but I revenge myself also for the bad liqueur which smells of fusel oil,
and I find an expression in the dream which unites both these reproaches:
the injection of a preparation of propyl. Still I am not satisfied, but
continue to avenge myself by comparing him with his more reliable colleague.
Thereby I seem to say: "I like him better than you." But Otto is not the
only person who must be made to feel the weight of my anger. I take my
revenge on the disobedient patient, by exchanging her for a more sensible
and more docile one. Nor do I pass over Dr. M's contradiction; for I express,
in an obvious allusion, my opinion of him: namely, that his attitude in
this case is that of an ignoramus (Dysentery will develop, etc.). Indeed,
it seems as though I were appealing from him to someone better informed
(my friend, who told me about trimethylamin), just as I have turned from
Irma to her friend, and from Otto to Leopold. It is as though I were to
say: Rid me of these three persons, replace them by three others of my
own choice, and I shall be rid of the reproaches which I am not willing
to admit that I deserve! In my dream the unreasonableness of these reproaches
is demonstrated for me in the most elaborate manner. Irma's pains are not
attributable to me, since she herself is to blame for them, in that she
refuses to accept my solution. They do not concern me, for being as they
are of an organic nature, they cannot possibly be cured by psychic treatment.
Irma's sufferings are satisfactorily explained by her widowhood (trimethylamin!);
a state which I cannot alter. Irma's illness has been caused by an incautious
injection administered by Otto, an injection of an unsuitable drug, such
as I should never have administered. Irma's complaint is the result of
an injection made with an unclean syringe, like the phlebitis of my old
lady patient, whereas my injections have never caused any ill effects.
I am aware that these explanations of Irma's illness, which unite in acquitting
me, do not agree with one another; that they even exclude one another.
The whole plea- for this dream is nothing else- recalls vividly the defence
offered by a man who was accused by his neighbour of having returned a
kettle in a damaged condition. In the first place, he had returned the
kettle undamaged; in the second place it already had holes in it when he
borrowed it; and in the third place, he had never borrowed it at all. A
complicated defence, but so much the better; if only one of these three
lines of defence is recognized as valid, the man must be acquitted.

<P>&nbsp;Still other themes play a part in the dream, and their relation
to my non-responsibility for Irma's illness is not so apparent: my daughter's
illness, and that of a patient with the same name; the harmfulness of cocaine;
the affection of my patient, who was traveling in Egypt; concern about
the health of my wife; my brother, and Dr. M; my own physical troubles,
and anxiety concerning my absent friend, who is suffering from suppurative
rhinitis. But if I keep all these things in view, they combine into a single
train of thought, which might be labelled: Concern for the health of myself
and others; professional conscientiousness. I recall a vaguely disagreeable
feeling when Otto gave me the news of Irma's condition. Lastly, I am inclined,
after the event, to find an expression of this fleeting sensation in the
train of thoughts which forms part of the dream. It is as though Otto had
said to me: "You do not take your medical duties seriously enough; you
are not conscientious; you do not perform what you promise." Thereupon
this train of thought placed itself at my service, in order that I might
give proof of my extreme conscientiousness, of my intimate concern about
the health of my relatives, friends and patients. Curiously enough, there
are also some painful memories in this material, which confirm the blame
attached to Otto rather than my own exculpation. The material is apparently
impartial, but the connection between this broader material, on which the
dream is based, and the more limited theme from which emerges the wish
to be innocent of Irma's illness, is, nevertheless, unmistakable.

<P>&nbsp;I do not wish to assert that I have entirely revealed the meaning
of the dream, or that my interpretation is flawless.

<P>&nbsp;I could still spend much time upon it; I could draw further explanations
from it, and discuss further problems which it seems to propound. I can
even perceive the points from which further mental associations might be
traced; but such considerations as are always involved in every dream of
one's own prevent me from interpreting it farther. Those who are overready
to condemn such reserve should make the experiment of trying to be more
straightforward. For the present I am content with the one fresh discovery
which has just been made: If the method of dream- interpretation here indicated
is followed, it will be found that dreams do really possess a meaning,
and are by no means the expression of a disintegrated cerebral activity,
as the writers on the subject would have us believe. When the work of interpretation
has been completed the dream can be recognized as a wish fulfilment.
