<H3>
H. The Affects in Dreams</H3>
A shrewd remark of Stricker's called our attention to the fact that the
expressions of affects in dreams cannot be disposed of in the contemptuous
fashion in which we are wont to shake off the dream-content after we have
waked. "If I am afraid of robbers in my dreams, the robbers, to be sure,
are imaginary, but the fear of them is real"; and the same thing is true
if I rejoice in my dream. According to the testimony of our feelings, an
affect experienced in a dream is in no way inferior to one of like intensity
experienced in waking life, and the dream presses its claim to be accepted
as part of our real psychic experiences, by virtue of its affective rather
than its ideational content. In the waking state, we do not put the one
before the other, since we do not know how to evaluate an affect psychically
except in connection with an ideational content. If an affect and an idea
are ill-matched as regards their nature or their intensity, our waking
judgment becomes confused.

<P>&nbsp;The fact that in dreams the ideational content does not always
produce the affective result which in our waking thoughts we should expect
as its necessary consequence has always been a cause of astonishment. Strumpell
declared that ideas in dreams are stripped of their psychic values. But
there is no lack of instances in which the reverse is true; when an intensive
manifestation of affect appears in a content which seems to offer no occasion
for it. In my dream I may be in a horrible, dangerous, or disgusting situation,
and yet I may feel no fear or aversion; on the other hand, I am sometimes
terrified by harmless things, and sometimes delighted by childish things.

<P>&nbsp;This enigma disappeared more suddenly and more completely than
perhaps any other dream-problem if we pass from the manifest to the latent
content. We shall then no longer have to explain it, for it will no longer
exist. Analysis tells us that the ideational contents have undergone displacements
and substitutions, while the affects have remained unchanged. No wonder,
then, that the ideational content which has been altered by dream-distortion
no longer fits the affect which has remained intact; and no cause for wonder
when analysis has put the correct content into its original place. *

<P>* If I am not greatly mistaken, the first dream which I was able to
elicit from my grandson (aged 20 months) points to the fact that the dream-work
had succeeded in transforming its material into a wish-fulfilment, while
the affect which belonged to it remained unchanged even in the sleeping
state. The night before its father was to return to the front the child
cried out, sobbing violently: "Papa, Papa- Baby." That may mean: Let Papa
and Baby still be together; while the weeping takes cognizance of the imminent
departure. The child was at the time very well able to express the concept
of separation. Fort (= away, replaced by a peculiarly accented, long-drawn-out
ooooh) had been his first word, and for many months before this first dream
he had played at away with all his toys; which went back to his early self-
conquest in allowing his mother to go away.

<P>In a psychic complex which has been subjected to the influence of the
resisting censorship, the affects are the unyielding constituent, which
alone can guide us to the correct completion. This state of affairs is
revealed in the psychoneuroses even more distinctly than in dreams. Here
the affect is always in the right, at least as regards its quality; its
intensity may, of course, be increased by displacement of the neurotic
attention. When the hysterical patient wonders that he should be so afraid
of a trifle, or when the sufferer from obsessions is astonished that he
should reproach himself so bitterly for a mere nothing, they are both in
error, inasmuch as they regard long conceptual content- the trifle, the
mere nothing- as the essential thing, and they defend themselves in vain,
because they make this conceptual content the starting-point of their thought-work.
Psycho-analysis, however, puts them on the right path, inasmuch as it recognizes
that, on the contrary, it is the affect that is justified, and looks for
the concept which pertains to it, and which has been repressed by a substitution.
All that we need assume is that the liberation of affect and the conceptual
content do not constitute the indissoluble organic unity as which we are
wont to regard them, but that the two parts may be welded together, so
that analysis will separate them. Dream- interpretation shows that this
is actually the case.

<P>&nbsp;I will first of all give an example in which analysis explains
the apparent absence of affect in a conceptual content which ought to compel
a liberation of affect.
<H4>
I.</H4>
The dreamer sees three lions in a desert, one of which is laughing, but
she is not afraid of them. Then, however, she must have fled from them,
for she is trying to climb a tree. But she finds that her cousin, the French
teacher, is already up in the tree, etc.

<P>&nbsp;The analysis yields the following material: The indifferent occasion
of the dream was a sentence in the dreamer's English exercise: "The lion's
greatest adornment is his mane." Her father used to wear a beard which
encircled his face like a Mane. The name of her English teacher is Miss
Lyons. An acquaintance of hers sent her the ballads of Loewe (Loewe = lion).
These, then, are the three lions; why should she be afraid of them? She
has read a story in which a negro who has incited his fellows to revolt
is hunted with bloodhounds, and climbs a tree to save himself. Then follow
fragmentary recollections in the merriest mood, such as the following directions
for catching lions (from Die Fliegende Blatter): "Take a desert and put
it through a sieve; the lions will be left behind." Also a very amusing,
but not very proper anecdote about an official who is asked why he does
not take greater pains to win the favour of his chief, and who replies
that he has been trying to creep into favour, but that his immediate superior
was already up there. The whole matter becomes intelligible as soon as
one learns that on the dream-day the lady had received a visit from her
husband's superior. He was very polite to her, and kissed her hand, and
she was not at all afraid of him, although he is a big bug (Grosses Tier
= big animal) and plays the part of a social lion in the capital of her
country. This lion is, therefore, like the lion in A Midsummer Night's
Dream, who is unmasked as Snug the joiner; and of such stuff are all the
dream-lions of which one is not afraid.
<H4>

As my second example, I will cite the dream of the girl who saw her sister's
little son lying as a corpse in his coffin, but who, it may be added, was
conscious of no pain or sorrow. Why she was unmoved we know from the analysis.
The dream only disguised her wish to see once more the man she loved; the
affect had to be attuned to the wish, and not to its disguisement. There
was thus no occasion for sorrow.

<P>&nbsp;In a number of dreams the affect does at least remain connected
with the conceptual content which has replaced the content really belonging
to it. In others, the dissolution of the complex is carried farther. The
affect is entirely separated from the idea belonging to it, and finds itself
accommodated elsewhere in the dream, where it fits into the new arrangement
of the dream- elements. We have seen that the same thing happens to acts
of judgment in dreams. If an important inference occurs in the dream- thoughts,
there is one in the dream also; but the inference in the dream may be displaced
to entirely different material. Not infrequently this displacement is effected
in accordance with the principle of antithesis.

<P>&nbsp;I will illustrate the latter possibility by the following dream,
which I have subjected to the most exhaustive analysis.
<H4>
III.</H4>
A castle by the sea; afterwards it lies not directly on the coast, but
on a narrow canal leading to the sea. A certain Herr P is the governor
of the castle. I stand with him in a large salon with three windows, in
front of which rise the projections of a wall, like battlements of a fortress.
I belong to the garrison, perhaps as a volunteer naval officer. We fear
the arrival of enemy warships, for we are in a state of war. Herr P intends
to leave the castle; he gives me instructions as to what must be done if
what we fear should come to pass. His sick wife and his children are in
the threatened castle. As soon as the bombardment begins, the large hall
is to be cleared. He breathes heavily, and tries to get away; I detain
him, and ask him how I am to send him news in case of need. He says something
further, and immediately afterwards he sinks to the floor dead. I have
probably taxed him unnecessarily with my questions. After his death, which
makes no further impression upon me, I consider whether the widow is to
remain in the castle, whether I should give notice of the death to the
higher command, whether I should take over the control of the castle as
the next in command. I now stand at the window, and scrutinize the ships
as they pass by; they are cargo steamers, and they rush by over the dark
water; several with more than one funnel, others with bulging decks (these
are very like the railway stations in the preliminary dream, which has
not been related). Then my brother is standing beside me, and we both look
out of the window on to the canal. At the sight of one ship we are alarmed,
and call out: "Here comes the warship!" It turns out, however, that they
are only the ships which I have already seen, returning. Now comes a small
ship, comically truncated, so that it ends amidships; on the deck one sees
curious things like cups or little boxes. We call out as with one voice:
"That is the breakfast ship."

<P>&nbsp;The rapid motion of the ships, the deep blue of the water, the
brown smoke of the funnels- all these together produce an intense and gloomy
impression.

<P>&nbsp;The localities in this dream are compiled from several journeys
to the Adriatic (Miramare, Duino, Venice, Aquileia). A short but enjoyable
Easter trip to Aquileia with my brother, a few weeks before the dream,
was still fresh in my memory; also the naval war between America and Spain,
and, associated with this my anxiety as to the fate of my relatives in
America, play a part in the dream. Manifestations of affect appear at two
places in the dream. In one place an affect that would be expected is lacking:
it expressly emphasized that the death of the governor makes no impression
upon me; at another point, when I see the warships, I am frightened, and
experience all the sensations of fright in my sleep. The distribution of
affects in this well-constructed dream has been effected in such a way
that any obvious contradiction is avoided. For there is no reason why I
should be frightened at the governor's death, and it is fitting that, as
the commander of the castle, I should be alarmed by the sight of the warship.
Now analysis shows that Herr P is nothing but a substitute for my own ego
(in the dream I am his substitute). I am the governor who suddenly dies.
The dream-thoughts deal with the future of my family after my premature
death. No other disagreeable thought is to be found among the dream-thoughts.
The alarm which goes with the sight of the warship must be transferred
from it to this disagreeable thought. Inversely, the analysis shows that
the region of the dream-thoughts from which the warship comes is laden
with most cheerful reminiscences. In Venice, a year before the dream, one
magically beautiful day, we stood at the windows of our room on the Riva
Schiavoni and looked out over the blue lagoon, on which there was more
traffic to be seen than usual. Some English ships were expected; they were
to be given a festive reception; and suddenly my wife cried, happy as a
child: "Here comes the English warship!" In the dream I am frightened by
the very same words; once more we see that speeches in dreams have their
origin in speeches in real life. I shall presently show that even the element
English in this speech has not been lost for the dream-work. Here, then,
between the dream-thoughts and the dream-content, I turn joy into fright,
and I need only point to the fact that by means of this transformation
I give expression to part of the latent dream-content. The example shows,
however, that the dream-work is at liberty to detach the occasion of an
affect from its connections in the dream-thoughts, and to insert it at
any other place it chooses in the dream- content.

<P>&nbsp;I will take the opportunity which is here, incidentally offered
of subjecting to a closer analysis the breakfast ship, whose appearance
in the dream so absurdly concludes a situation that has been rationally
adhered to. If I look more closely at this dream-object, I am impressed
after the event by the fact that it was black. and that by reason of its
truncation at its widest beam it achieved, at the truncated end, a considerable
resemblance to an object which had aroused our interest in the museums
of the Etruscan cities. This object was a rectangular cup of black clay,
with two handles, upon which stood things like coffee-cups or tea-cups,
very similar to our modern service for the breakfast table. Upon inquiry
we learned that this was the toilet set of an Etruscan lady, with little
boxes for rouge and powder; and we told one another jestingly that it would
not be a bad idea to take a thing like that home to the lady of the house.
The dream-object, therefore, signifies a black toilet (toilette = dress),
or mourning. and refers directly to a death. The other end of the dream-object
reminds us of the boat (German, Nachen, from the Greek root, nechus, as
a philological friend informs me), upon which corpses were laid in prehistoric
times, and were left to be buried by the sea. This is associated with the
return of the ships in the dream.

<P>&nbsp;"Silently on his rescued boat the old man drifts into harbour."

<P>&nbsp;It is the return voyage after the shipwreck (German: Schiff-bruch
= ship-breaking); the breakfast ship looks as though it were broken off
amidships. But whence comes the name breakfast ship? This is where English
comes in, which we have left over from the warships. Breakfast, a breaking
of the fast. Breaking again belongs to shipwreck (Schiff-bruch), and fasting
is associated with the black (mourning).

<P>&nbsp;But the only thing about this breakfast ship which has been newly
created by the dream is its name. The thing existed in reality, and recalls
to me one of the merriest moments of my last journey. As we distrusted
the fare in Aquileia, we took some food with us from Goerz, and bought
a bottle of the excellent Istrian wine in Aquileia; and while the little
mail-steamer slowly travelled through the canale

<P>&nbsp;delle Mee and into the lonely expanse of lagoon in the direction
of Grado, we had breakfast on deck in the highest spirits- we were the
only passengers- and it tasted to us as few breakfasts have ever tasted.
This, then, was the breakfast ship, and it is behind this very recollection
of the gayest joie de vivre that the dream hides the saddest thoughts of
an unknown and mysterious future.

<P>&nbsp;The detachment of affects from the groups of ideas which have
occasioned their liberation is the most striking thing that happens to
them in dream-formation, but it is neither the only nor even the most essential
change which they undergo on the way from the dream-thoughts to the manifest
dream. If the affects in the dream-thoughts are compared with those in
the dream, one thing at once becomes clear: Wherever there is an affect
in the dream, it is to be found also in the dream-thoughts; the converse,
however, is not true. In general, a dream is less rich in affects than
the psychic material from which it is elaborated. When I have reconstructed
the dream-thoughts, I see that the most intense psychic impulses are constantly
striving in them for self- assertion, usually in conflict with others which
are sharply opposed to them. Now, if I turn back to the dream. I often
find it colourless and devoid of any very intensive affective tone. Not
only the content, but also the affective tone of my thoughts is often reduced
by the dream-work to the level of the indifferent. I might say that a suppression
of the affects has been accomplished by the dream-work. Take, for example,
the dream of the botanical monograph. It corresponds to a passionate plea
for my freedom to act as I am acting, to arrange my life as seems right
to me, and to me alone. The dream which results from this sounds indifferent;
I have written a monograph; it is lying before me; it is provided with
coloured plates, and dried plants are to be found in each copy. It is like
the peace of a deserted battlefield; no trace is left of the tumult of
battle.

<P>&nbsp;But things may turn out quite differently; vivid expressions of
affect may enter into the dream itself; but we will first of all consider
the unquestioned fact that so many dreams appear indifferent, whereas it
is never possible to go deeply into the dream-thoughts without deep emotion.

<P>&nbsp;The complete theoretical explanation of this suppression of affects
during the dream-work cannot be given here; it would require a most careful
investigation of the theory of the affects and of the mechanism of repression.
Here I can put forward only two suggestions. I am forced- for other reasons-
to conceive the liberation of affects as a centrifugal process directed
towards the interior of the body, analogous to the processes of motor and
secretory innervation. Just as in the sleeping state the emission of motor
impulses towards the outer world seems to be suspended, so the centrifugal
awakening of affects by unconscious thinking during sleep may be rendered
more difficult. The affective impulses which occur during the course of
the dream-thoughts may thus in themselves be feeble, so that those that
find their way into the dream are no stronger. According to this line of
thought, the suppression of the affects would not be a consequence of the
dream-work at all, but a consequence of the state of sleep. This may be
so, but it cannot possibly be all the truth. We must remember that all
the more complex dreams have revealed themselves as the result of a compromise
between conflicting psychic forces. On the one hand, the wish-forming thoughts
have to oppose the contradiction of a censorship; on the other hand, as
we have often seen, even in unconscious thinking, every train of thought
is harnessed to its contradictory counterpart. Since all these trains of
thought are capable of arousing affects, we shall, broadly speaking, hardly
go astray if we conceive the suppression of affects as the result of the
inhibition which the contrasts impose upon one another, and the censorship
upon the urges which it has suppressed. The inhibition of affects would
accordingly be the second consequence of the dream-censorship, just as
dream-distortion was the first consequence.

<P>&nbsp;I will here insert an example of a dream in which the indifferent
emotional tone of the dream-content may be explained by the antagonism
of the dream-thoughts. I must relate the following short dream, which every
reader will read with disgust.
<H4>
IV.</H4>
Rising ground, and on it something like an open-air latrine; a very long
bench, at the end of which is a wide aperture. The whole of the back edge
is thickly covered with little heaps of excrement of all sizes and degrees
of freshness. A thicket behind the bench. I urinate upon the bench; a long
stream of urine rinses everything clean, the patches of excrement come
off easily and fall into the opening. Nevertheless, it seems as though
something remained at the end.

<P>&nbsp;Why did I experience no disgust in this dream?

<P>&nbsp;Because, as the analysis shows, the most pleasant and gratifying
thoughts have cooperated in the formation of this dream. Upon analysing
it, I immediately think of the Augean stables which were cleansed by Hercules.
I am this Hercules. The rising ground and the thicket belong to Aussee,
where my children are now staying. I have discovered the infantile aetiology
of the neuroses, and have thus guarded my own children from falling ill.
The bench (omitting the aperture, of course) is the faithful copy of a
piece of furniture of which an affectionate female patient has made me
a present. This reminds me how my patients honour me. Even the museum of
human excrement is susceptible of a gratifying interpretation. However
much it disgusts me, it is a souvenir of the beautiful land of Italy, where
in the small cities, as everyone knows, the privies are not equipped in
any other way. The stream of urine that washes everything clean is an unmistakable
allusion to greatness. It is in this manner that Gulliver extinguishes
the great fire in Lilliput; to be sure, he thereby incurs the displeasure
of the tiniest of queens. In this way, too, Gargantua, the superman of
Master Rabelais, takes vengeance upon the Parisians, straddling Notre-Dame
and training his stream of urine upon the city. Only yesterday I was turning
over the leaves of Garnier's illustrations to Rabelais before I went to
bed. And, strangely enough, here is another proof that I am the superman!
The platform of Notre-Dame was my favourite nook in Paris; every free afternoon
I used to go up into the towers of the cathedral and there clamber about
between the monsters and gargoyles. The circumstance that all the excrement
vanishes so rapidly before the stream of urine corresponds to the motto:
Afflavit et dissipati sunt, which I shall some day make the title of a
chapter on the therapeutics of hysteria.

<P>&nbsp;And now as to the affective occasion of the dream. It had been
a hot summer afternoon; in the evening, I had given my lecture on the connection
between hysteria and the perversions, and everything which I had to say
displeased me thoroughly, and seemed utterly valueless. I was tired; I
took not the least pleasure in my difficult work, and longed to get away
from this rummaging in human filth; first to see my children, and then
to revisit the beauties of Italy. In this mood I went from the lecture-hall
to a cafe to get some little refreshment in the open air, for my appetite
had forsaken me. But a member of my audience went with me; he begged for
permission to sit with me while I drank my coffee and gulped down my roll,
and began to say flattering things to me. He told me how much he had learned
from me, that he now saw everything through different eyes, that I had
cleansed the Augean stables of error and prejudice, which encumbered the
theory of the neuroses- in short, that I was a very great man. My mood
was ill-suited to his hymn of praise; I struggled with my disgust, and
went home earlier in order to get rid of him; and before I went to sleep
I turned over the leaves of Rabelais, and read a short story by C. F. Meyer
entitled Die Leiden eines Knaben (The Sorrows of a Boy).

<P>&nbsp;The dream had originated from this material, and Meyer's novel
had supplied the recollections of scenes of childhood. * The day's mood
of annoyance and disgust is continued in the dream, inasmuch as it is permitted
to furnish nearly all the material for the dream-content. But during the
night the opposite mood of vigorous, even immoderate self-assertion awakened
and dissipated the earlier mood. The dream had to assume such a form as
would accommodate both the expressions of self-depreciation and exaggerated
self-glorification in the same material. This compromise-formation resulted
in an ambiguous dream-content, but, owing to the mutual inhibition of the
opposites, in an indifferent emotional tone.

<P>* Cf. the dream about Count Thun, last scene.

<P>According to the theory of wish-fulfilment, this dream would not have
been possible had not the opposed, and indeed suppressed, yet pleasure-emphasized
megalomanic train of thought been added to the thoughts of disgust. For
nothing painful is intended to be represented in dreams; the painful elements
of our daily thoughts are able to force their way into our dreams only
if at the same time they are able to disguise a wish-fulfilment.

<P>&nbsp;The dream-work is able to dispose of the affects of the dream-
thoughts in yet another way than by admitting them or reducing them to
zero. It can transform them into their opposites. We are acquainted with
the rule that for the purposes of interpretation every element of the dream
may represent its opposite, as well as itself. One can never tell beforehand
which is to be posited; only the context can decide this point. A suspicion
of this state of affairs has evidently found its way into the popular consciousness;
the dream-books, in their interpretations, often proceed according to the
principle of contraries. This transformation into the contrary is made
possible by the intimate associative ties which in our thoughts connect
the idea of a thing with that of its opposite. Like every other displacement,
this serves the purposes of the censorship, but it is often the work of
wish-fulfilment, for wish-fulfilment consists in nothing more than the
substitution of an unwelcome thing by its opposite. Just as concrete images
may be transformed into their contraries in our dreams, so also may the
affects of the dream-thoughts, and it is probable that this inversion of
affects is usually brought about by the dream-censorship. The suppression
and inversion of affects is useful even in social life, as is shown by
the familiar analogy of the dream-censorship and, above all, hypocrisy.
If I am conversing with a person to whom I must show consideration while
I should like to address him as an enemy, it is almost more important that
I should conceal the expression of my affect from him than that I should
modify the verbal expression of my thoughts. If I address him in courteous
terms, but accompany them by looks or gestures of hatred and disdain, the
effect which I produce upon him is not very different from what it would
have been had I cast my unmitigated contempt into his face. Above all,
then, the censorship bids me suppress my affects. and if I am a master
of the art of dissimulation I can hypocritically display the opposite affect-
smiling where I should like to be angry, and pretending affection where
I should like to destroy.

<P>&nbsp;We have already had an excellent example of such an inversion
of affect in the service of the dream-censorship. In the dream of my uncle's
beard I feel great affection for my friend R, while (and because) the dream-thoughts
berate him as a simpleton. From this example of the inversion of affects
we derived our first proof of the existence of the censorship. Even here
it is not necessary to assume that the dream-work creates a counter-affect
of this kind that is altogether new; it usually finds it lying ready in
the material of the dream-thoughts, and merely intensifies it with the
psychic force of the defence-motives until it is able to predominate in
the dream-formation. In the dream of my uncle, the affectionate counter-affect
probably has its origin in an infantile source (as the continuation of
the dream would suggest), for owing to the peculiar nature of my earliest
childhood experiences the relation of uncle and nephew has become the source
of all my friendships and hatreds (cf. analysis chapter VI., F.).

<P>&nbsp;An excellent example of such a reversal of affect is found in
a dream recorded by Ferenczi. * "An elderly gentleman was awakened at night
by his wife, who was frightened because he laughed so loudly and uncontrollably
in his sleep. The man afterwards related that he had had the following
dream: I lay in my bed, a gentleman known to me came in, I wanted to turn
on the light, but I could not; I attempted to do so repeatedly, but in
vain. Thereupon my wife got out of bed, in order to help me, but she, too,
was unable to manage it; being ashamed of her neglige in the presence of
the gentleman, she finally gave it up and went back to her bed; all this
was so comical that I had to laugh terribly. My wife said: 'What are you
laughing at, what are you laughing at?' but I continued to laugh until
I woke. The following day the man was extremely depressed, and suffered
from headache: 'From too much laughter, which shook me up,' he thought.

<P>* Internat. Zeitschr. f. Psychoanalyse, IV (1916).

<P>"Analytically considered, the dream looks less comical. In the latent
dream-thoughts the gentleman known to him who came into the room is the
image of death as the 'great unknown,' which was awakened in his mind on
the previous day. The old gentleman, who suffers from arteriosclerosis,
had good reason to think of death on the day before the dream. The uncontrollable
laughter takes the place of weeping and sobbing at the idea that he has
to die. It is the light of life that he is no longer able to turn on. This
mournful thought may have associated itself with a failure to effect sexual
intercourse, which he had attempted shortly before this, and in which the
assistance of his wife en neglige was of no avail; he realized that he
was already on the decline. The dream-work knew how to transform the sad
idea of impotence and death into a comic scene, and the sobbing into laughter."

<P>&nbsp;There is one class of dreams which has a special claim to be called
hypocritical, and which severely tests the theory of wish- fulfilment.
My attention was called to them when Frau Dr. M. Hilferding proposed for
discussion by the Psychoanalytic Society of Vienna a dream recorded by
Rosegger, which is here reprinted:

<P>&nbsp;In Waldheimat, vol. xi, Rosegger writes as follows in his story,
Fremd gemacht (p. 303):

<P>&nbsp;"I usually enjoy healthful sleep, yet I have gone without repose
on many a night; in addition to my modest existence as a student and literary
man, I have for long years dragged out the shadow of a veritable tailor's
life- like a ghost from which I could not become divorced.

<P>&nbsp;"It is not true that I have occupied myself very often or very
intensely with thoughts of my past during the day. A stormer of heaven
and earth who has escaped from the hide of the Philistine has other things
to think about. And as a gay young fellow, I hardly gave a thought to my
nocturnal dreams; only later, when I had formed the habit of thinking about
everything, or when the Philistine within me began to assert itself a little,
did it strike me that- when I dreamed at all- I was always a journeyman
tailor, and that in that capacity I had already worked in my master's shop
for a long time without any pay. As I sat there beside him, and sewed and
pressed, I was perfectly well aware that I no longer belonged there, and
that as a burgess of the town I had other things to attend to; but I was
always on a holiday, or away in the country, and so I sat beside my master
and helped him. I often felt far from comfortable about it, and regretted
the waste of time which I might have employed for better and more useful
purposes. If anything was not quite correct in measure and cut I had to
put up with a scolding from my master. Of wages there was never a question.
Often, as I sat with bent back in the dark workshop, I decided to give
notice and make myself scarce. Once I actually did so, but the master took
no notice of me, and next time I was sitting beside him again and sewing.

<P>&nbsp;"How happy I was when I woke up after such weary hours! And I
then resolved that, if this intrusive dream should ever occur again, I
would energetically throw it off, and would cry aloud: 'It is only a delusion,
I am lying in bed, and I want to sleep'... And the next night I would be
sitting in the tailor's shop again.

<P>&nbsp;"So it went on for years, with dismal regularity. Once when the
master and I were working at Alpelhofer's, at the house of the peasant
with whom I began my apprenticeship, it happened that my master was particularly
dissatisfied with my work. 'I should like to know where in the world your
thoughts are?' he cried, and looked at me sullenly. I thought the most
sensible thing to do would be to get up and explain to the master that
I was working with him only as a favour, and then take my leave. But I
did not do this. I even submitted when the master engaged an apprentice,
and ordered me to make room for him on the bench. I moved into the corner,
and kept on sewing. On the same day another journeyman was engaged; a bigoted
fellow; he was the Bohemian who had worked for us nineteen years earlier,
and then had fallen into the lake on his way home from the public-house.
When he tried to sit down there was no room for him. I looked at the master
inquiringly, and he said to me: 'You have no talent for tailoring; you
may go; you're a stranger henceforth.' My fright on that occasion was so
overpowering that I woke.

<P>&nbsp;"The grey of morning glimmered through the clear windows of my
familiar home. Objets d'art surrounded me; in the tasteful bookcase stood
the eternal Homer, the gigantic Dante, the incomparable Shakespeare, the
glorious Goethe- all radiant and immortal. From the adjoining room resounded
the clear little voices of the children, who were waking up and prattling
to their mother. I felt as though I had rediscovered that idyllically sweet,
peaceful, poetical and spiritualized life in which I have so often and
so deeply been conscious of contemplative human happiness. And yet I was
vexed that I had not given my master notice first, but had been dismissed
by him.

<P>&nbsp;"And how remarkable this seems to me: since that night, when my
master 'made a stranger' of me, I have enjoyed restful sleep; I no longer
dream of my tailoring days, which now lie in the remote past: which in
their unpretentious simplicity were really so cheerful, but which, none
the less, have cast a long shadow over the later years of my life."

<P>&nbsp;In this series of dreams of a poet who, in his younger years,
had been a journeyman tailor, it is hard to recognize the domination of
the wish-fulfilment. All the delightful things occurred in his waking life,
while the dream seemed to drag along with it the ghost-like shadow of an
unhappy existence which had long been forgotten. Dreams of my own of a
similar character enable me to give some explanation of such dreams. As
a young doctor, I worked for a long time in the Chemical Institute without
being able to accomplish anything in that exacting science, so that in
the waking state I never think about this unfruitful and actually somewhat
humiliating period of my student days. On the other hand, I have a recurring
dream to the effect that I am working in the laboratory, making analyses,
and experiments, and so forth; these dreams, like the examination-dreams,
are disagreeable, and they are never very distinct. During the analysis
of one of these dreams my attention was directed to the word analysis,
which gave me the key to an understanding of them. Since then I have become
an analyst. I make analyses which are greatly praised- psycho- analyses,
of course. Now I understand: when I feel proud of these analyses in my
waking life, and feel inclined to boast of my achievements, my dreams hold
up to me at night those other, unsuccessful analyses, of which I have no
reason to be proud; they are the punitive dreams of the upstart, like those
of the journeyman tailor who became a celebrated poet. But how is it possible
for a dream to place itself at the service of self- criticism in its conflict
with parvenu pride, and to take as its content a rational warning instead
of a prohibited wish- fulfilment? I have already hinted that the answer
to this question presents many difficulties. We may conclude that the foundation
of the dream consisted at first of an arrogant phantasy of ambition; but
that in its stead only its suppression and abasement has reached the dream-content.
One must remember that there are masochistic tendencies in mental life
to which such an inversion might be attributed. I see no objection to regarding
such dreams as punishment-dreams, as distinguished from wish-fulfilling
dreams. I should not see in this any limitation of the theory of dreams
hitherto as presented, but merely a verbal concession to the point of view
to which the convergence of contraries seems strange. But a more thorough
investigation of individual dreams of this class allows us to recognize
yet another element. In an indistinct, subordinate portion of one of my
laboratory dreams, I was just at the age which placed me in the most gloomy
and most unsuccessful year of my professional career; I still had no position,
and no idea how I was going to support myself, when I suddenly found that
I had the choice of several women whom I might marry! I was, therefore,
young again and, what is more, she was young again- the woman who has shared
with me all these difficult years. In this way, one of the wishes which
constantly gnaws at the heart of the aging man was revealed as the unconscious
dream-instigator. The conflict raging in other psychic strata between vanity
and self-criticism had certainly determined the dream-content, but the
more deeply-rooted wish for youth had alone made it possible as a dream.
One often says to oneself even in the waking state: "To be sure, things
are going well with you today, and once you found life very hard; but,
after all, life was sweet in those days, when you were still so young."
*

<P>* Ever since psycho-analysis has dissected the personality into an ego
and a super-ego (Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, p. 664 below),
it has been easy to recognize in these punishment-dreams wishfulfilments
of the super-ego.

<P>Another group of dreams, which I have often myself experienced, and
which I have recognized to be hypocritical, have as their content a reconciliation
with persons with whom one has long ceased to have friendly relations.
The analysis constantly discovers an occasion which might well induce me
to cast aside the last remnants of consideration for these former friends,
and to treat them as strangers or enemies. But the dream chooses to depict
the contrary relation.

<P>&nbsp;In considering dreams recorded by a novelist or poet, we may often
enough assume that he has excluded from the record those details which
he felt to be disturbing and regarded as unessential. His dreams thus set
us a problem which could be readily solved if we had an exact reproduction
of the dream- content.

<P>&nbsp;O. Rank has called my attention to the fact that in Grimm's fairy-
tale of the valiant little tailor, or Seven at One Stroke, there is related
a very similar dream of an upstart. The tailor, who has become a hero,
and has married the king's daughter, dreams one night while lying beside
the princess, his wife, about his trade; having become suspicious, on the
following night she places armed guards where they can listen to what is
said by the dreamer, and arrest him. But the little tailor is warned, and
is able to correct his dream.

<P>&nbsp;The complicated processes of removal, diminution, and inversion
by which the affects of the dream-thoughts finally become the affects of
the dream may be very well survived in suitable syntheses of completely
analysed dreams. I shall here discuss a few examples of affective manifestations
in dreams which will, I think, prove this conclusively in some of the cases
cited.
<H4>
V.</H4>
In the dream about the odd task which the elder Brucke sets me- that of
preparing my own pelvis- I am aware in the dream itself of not feeling
appropriate horror. Now this is a wish-fulfilment in more senses than one.
The preparation signifies the self- analyses which I perform, as it were,
by publishing my book on dreams, which I actually found so painful that
I postponed the printing of the completed manuscript for more than a year.
The wish now arises that I may disregard this feeling of aversion, and
for that reason I feel no horror (Grauen, which also means to grow grey)
in the dream. I should much like to escape Grauen in the other sense too,
for I am already growing quite grey, and the grey in my hair warns me to
delay no longer. For we know that at the end of the dream this thought
secures representation: "I shall have to leave my children to reach the
goal of their difficult journey without my help."

<P>&nbsp;In the two dreams that transfer the expression of satisfaction
to the moments immediately after waking, this satisfaction is in the one
case motivated by the expectation that I am now going to learn what is
meant by I have already dreamed of this, and refers in reality to the birth
of my first child, and in the other case it is motivated by the conviction
that "that which has been announced by a premonitory sign" is now going
to happen, and the satisfaction is that which I felt on the arrival of
my second son. Here the same affects that dominated in the dream-thoughts
have remained in the dream, but the process is probably not quite so simple
as this in any dream. If the two analyses are examined a little more closely
it will be seen that this satisfaction, which does not succumb to the censorship,
receives reinforcement from a source which must fear the censorship, and
whose affect would certainly have aroused opposition if it had not screened
itself by a similar and readily admitted affect of satisfaction from the
permitted source, and had, so to speak, sneaked in behind it. I am unfortunately
unable to show this in the case of the actual dream, but an example from
another situation will make my meaning intelligible. I will put the following
case: Let there be a person near me whom I hate so strongly that I have
a lively impulse to rejoice should anything happen to him. But the moral
side of my nature does not give way to this impulse; I do not dare to express
this sinister wish, and when something does happen to him which he does
not deserve I suppress my satisfaction, and force myself to thoughts and
expressions of regret. Everyone will at some time have found himself in
such a position. But now let it happen that the hated person, through some
transgression of his own, draws upon himself a well-deserved calamity;
I shall now be allowed to give free rein to my satisfaction at his being
visited by a just punishment, and I shall be expressing an opinion which
coincides with that of other impartial persons. But I observe that my satisfaction
proves to be more intense than that of others, for it has received reinforcement
from another source- from my hatred, which was hitherto prevented by the
inner censorship from furnishing the affect, but which, under the altered
circumstances, is no longer prevented from doing so. This case generally
occurs in social life when antipathetic persons or the adherents of an
unpopular minority have been guilty of some offence. Their punishment is
then usually commensurate not with their guilt, but with their guilt plus
the ill-will against them that has hitherto not been put into effect. Those
who punish them doubtless commit an injustice, but they are prevented from
becoming aware of it by the satisfaction arising from the release within
themselves of a suppression of long standing. In such cases the quality
of the affect is justified, but not its degree; and the self-criticism
that has been appeased in respect of the first point is only too ready
to neglect to scrutinize the second point. Once you have opened the doors,
more people enter than it was your original intention to admit.

<P>&nbsp;A striking feature of the neurotic character, namely, that in
it causes capable of evoking affect produce results which are qualitatively
justified but quantitatively excessive, is to be explained on these lines,
in so far as it admits of a psychological explanation at all. But the excess
of affect proceeds from unconscious and hitherto suppressed affective sources
which are able to establish an associative connection with the actual occasion,
and for whose liberation of affect the unprotested and permitted source
of affects opens up the desired path. Our attention is thus called to the
fact that the relation of mutual inhibition must not be regarded as the
only relation obtaining between the suppressed and the suppressing psychic
institution. The cases in which the two institutions bring about a pathological
result by co-operation and mutual reinforcement deserve just as much attention.
These hints regarding the psychic mechanism will contribute to our understanding
of the expressions of affects in dreams. A gratification which makes its
appearance in a dream, and which, of course, may readily be found in its
proper place in the dream-thoughts, may not always be fully explained by
means of this reference. As a rule, it is necessary to search for a second
source in the dream-thoughts, upon which the pressure of the censorship
rests, and which, under this pressure, would have yielded not gratification
but the contrary affect, had it not been enabled by the presence of the
first dream-source to free its gratification-affect from repression, and
reinforce the gratification springing from the other source. Hence affects
which appear in dreams appear to be formed by the confluence of several
tributaries, and are over-determined in respect of the material of the
dream-thoughts. Sources of affect which are able to furnish the same affect
combine in the dream- work in order to produce it. *

<P>* I have since explained the extraordinary effect of pleasure produced
by tendency wit on analogous lines.

<P>Some insight into these involved relations is gained from the analysis
of the admirable dream in which Non vixit constitutes the central point
(cf. chapter VI., F). In this dream expressions of affect of different
qualities are concentrated at two points in the manifest content. Hostile
and painful impulses (in the dream itself we have the phrase overcome by
strange emotions) overlap one another at the point where I destroy my antagonistic
friend with a couple of words. At the end of the dream I am greatly pleased,
and am quite ready to believe in a possibility which I recognize as absurd
when I am awake, namely, that there are revenants who can be swept away
by a mere wish.

<P>&nbsp;I have not yet mentioned the occasion of this dream. It is an
important one, and leads us far down into the meaning of the dream. From
my friend in Berlin (whom I have designated as Fl) I had received the news
that he was about to undergo an operation, and that relatives of his living
in Vienna would inform me as to his condition. The first few messages after
the operation were not very reassuring, and caused me great anxiety. I
should have liked to go to him myself, but at that time I was afflicted
with a painful complaint which made every movement a torment. I now learn
from the dream-thoughts that I feared for this dear friend's life. I knew
that his only sister, with whom I had never been acquainted, had died young,
after a very brief illness. (In the dream Fl tells me about his sister,
and says: "In three- quarters of an hour she was dead.") I must have imagined
that his own constitution was not much stronger, and that I should soon
be travelling, in spite of my health, in response to far worse news- and
that I should arrive too late, for which I should eternally reproach myself.
* This reproach, that I should arrive too late, has become the central
point of the dream, but it has been represented in a scene in which the
revered teacher of my student years- Brucke- reproaches me for the same
thing with a terrible look from his blue eyes. What brought about this
alteration of the scene will soon become apparent: the dream cannot reproduce
the scene itself as I experienced it. To be sure, it leaves the blue eyes
to the other man, but it gives me the part of the annihilator, an inversion
which is obviously the work of the wish- fulfilment. My concern for the
life of my friend, my self- reproach for not having gone to him, my shame
(he had come to me in Vienna unobtrusively), my desire to consider myself
excused on account of my illness- all this builds up an emotional tempest
which is distinctly felt in my sleep, and which rages in that region of
the dream-thoughts.

<P>* It is this fancy from the unconscious dream-thoughts which peremptorily
demands non vivit instead of non vixit. "You have come too late, he is
no longer alive." The fact that the manifest situation of the dream aims
at the non vivit has been mentioned in chapter VI., G.

<P>But there was another thing in the occasion of the dream which had quite
the opposite effect. With the unfavourable news during the first days of
the operation I received also an injunction to speak to no one about the
whole affair, which hurt my feelings, for it betrayed an unnecessary distrust
of my discretion. I knew, of course, that this request did not proceed
from my friend, but that it was due to clumsiness or excessive timidity
on the part of the messenger; yet the concealed reproach affected me very
disagreeably, because it was not altogether unjustified. As we know, only
reproaches which have something in them have the power to hurt. Years ago,
when I was younger than I am now, I knew two men who were friends, and
who honoured me with their friendship; and I quite superfluously told one
of them what the other had said of him. This incident, of course, had nothing
to do with the affairs of my friend Fl, but I have never forgotten the
reproaches to which I had to listen on that occasion. One of the two friends
between whom I made trouble was Professor Fleischl; the other one I will
call by his baptismal name, Josef, a name which was borne also by my friend
and antagonist P, who appears in this dream.

<P>&nbsp;In the dream the element unobtrusively points to the reproach
that I cannot keep anything to myself, and so does the question of Fl as
to how much of his affairs I have told P. But it is the intervention of
that old memory which transposes the reproach for arriving too late from
the present to the time when I was working in Brucke's laboratory; and
by replacing the second person in the annihilation scene of the dream by
a Josef, I enable this scene to represent not only the first reproach-
that I have arrived too late- but also that other reproach, more strongly
affected by the repression, to the effect that I do not keep secrets. The
work of condensation and displacement in this dream, as well as the motives
for it, are now obvious.

<P>&nbsp;My present trivial annoyance at the injunction not to divulge
secrets draws reinforcement from springs that flow far beneath the surface,
and so swells to a stream of hostile impulses towards persons who are in
reality dear to me. The source which furnishes the reinforcement is to
be found in my childhood. I have already said that my warm friendships
as well as my enmities with persons of my own age go back to my childish
relations to my nephew, who was a year older than I. In these he had the
upper hand, and I early learned how to defend myself; we lived together,
were inseparable, and loved one another, but at times, as the statements
of older persons testify, we used to squabble and accuse one another. In
a certain sense, all my friends are incarnations of this first figure;
they are all revenants. My nephew himself returned when a young man, and
then we were like Caesar and Brutus. An intimate friend and a hated enemy
have always been indispensable to my emotional life; I have always been
able to create them anew, and not infrequently my childish ideal has been
so closely approached that friend and enemy have coincided in the same
person; but not simultaneously, of course, nor in constant alternation,
as was the case in my early childhood.

<P>&nbsp;How, when such associations exist, a recent occasion of emotion
may cast back to the infantile occasion and substitute this as a cause
of affect, I shall not consider now. Such an investigation would properly
belong to the psychology of unconscious thought, or a psychological explanation
of the neuroses. Let us assume, for the purposes of dream-interpretation,
that a childish recollection presents itself, or is created by the phantasy
with, more or less, the following content: We two children quarrel on account
of some object- just what we shall leave undecided, although the memory,
or illusion of memory, has a very definite object in view- and each claims
that he got there first, and therefore has the first right to it. We come
to blows; Might comes before Right; and, according to the indications of
the dream, I must have known that I was in the wrong (noticing the error
myself); but this time I am the stronger, and take possession of the battlefield;
the defeated combatant hurries to my father, his grandfather, and accuses
me, and I defend myself with the words, which I have heard from my father:
"I hit him because he hit me." Thus, this recollection, or more probably
phantasy, which forces itself upon my attention in the course of the analysis-
without further evidence I myself do not know how- becomes a central item
of the dream-thoughts, which collects the affective impulses prevailing
in the dream-thoughts, as the bowl of a fountain collects the water that
flows into it. From this point the dream-thoughts flow along the following
channels: "It serves you right that you have had to make way for me; why
did you try to push me off? I don't need you; I'll soon find someone else
to play with," etc. Then the channels are opened through which these thoughts
flow back again into the dream- representation. For such an "ote-toi que
je m'y mette," * I once had to reproach my deceased friend Josef. He was
next to me in the line of promotion in Brucke's laboratory, but advancement
there was very slow. Neither of the two assistants budged from his place,
and youth became impatient. My friend, who knew that his days were numbered,
and was bound by no intimate relation to his superior, sometimes gave free
expression to his impatience. As this superior was a man seriously ill,
the wish to see him removed by promotion was susceptible of an obnoxious
secondary interpretation. Several years earlier, to be sure, I myself had
cherished, even more intensely, the same wish- to obtain a post which had
fallen vacant; wherever there are gradations of rank and promotion the
way is opened for the suppression of covetous wishes. Shakespeare's Prince
Hal cannot rid himself of the temptation to see how the crown fits, even
at the bedside of his sick father. But, as may readily be understood, the
dream inflicts this inconsiderate wish not upon me, but upon my friend.
*(2)

<P>* Make room for me.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) It will have been obvious that the name Josef plays a great
part in my dreams (see the dream about my uncle). It is particularly easy
for me to hide my ego in my dreams behind persons of this name, since Joseph
was the name of the dream- interpreter in the Bible.

<P>"As he was ambitious, I slew him." As he could not expect that the other
man would make way for him, the man himself has been put out of the way.
I harbour these thoughts immediately after attending the unveiling of the
memorial to the other man at the University. Part of the satisfaction which
I feel in the dream may therefore be interpreted: A just punishment; it
serves you right.

<P>&nbsp;At the funeral of this friend a young man made the following remark,
which seemed rather out of place: "The preacher talked as though the world
could no longer exist without this one human being." Here was a stirring
of revolt in the heart of a sincere man, whose grief had been disturbed
by exaggeration. But with this speech are connected the dream-thoughts:
"No one is really irreplaceable; how many men have I already escorted to
the grave! But I am still alive; I have survived them all; I claim the
field." Such a thought, at the moment when I fear that if I make a journey
to see him I shall find my friend no longer among the living, permits only
of the further development that I am glad once more to have survived someone;
that it is not I who have died but he; that I am master of the field, as
once I was in the imagined scene of my childhood. This satisfaction, infantile
in origin, at the fact that I am master of the field, covers the greater
part of the affect which appears in the dream. I am glad that I am the
survivor; I express this sentiment with the naive egoism of the husband
who says to his wife: "If one of us dies, I shall move to Paris." My expectation
takes it as a matter of course that I am not the one to die.

<P>&nbsp;It cannot be denied that great self-control is needed to interpret
one's dreams and to report them. One has to reveal oneself as the sole
villain among all the noble souls with whom one shares the breath of life.
Thus, I find it quite comprehensible that revenants should exist only as
long as one wants them, and that they can be obliterated by a wish. It
was for this reason that my friend Josef was punished. But the revenants
are the successive incarnations of the friend of my childhood; I am also
gratified at having replaced this person for myself over and over again,
and a substitute will doubtless soon be found even for the friend whom
I am now on the point of losing. No one is irreplaceable.

<P>&nbsp;But what has the dream-censorship been doing in the meantime?
Why does it not raise the most emphatic objection to a train of thoughts
characterized by such brutal selfishness, and transform the satisfaction
inherent therein into extreme discomfort? I think it is because other unobjectionable
trains of thought referring to the same persons result also in satisfaction,
and with their affect cover that proceeding from the forbidden infantile
sources. In another stratum of thought I said to myself, at the ceremony
of unveiling the memorial: "I have lost so many dear friends, some through
death, some through the dissolution of friendship; is it not good that
substitutes have presented themselves, that I have gained a friend who
means more to me than the others could, and whom I shall now always retain,
at an age when it is not easy to form new friendships?" The gratification
of having found this substitute for my lost friend can be taken over into
the dream without interference, but behind it there sneaks in the hostile
feeling of malicious gratification from the infantile source. Childish
affection undoubtedly helps to reinforce the rational affection of today;
but childish hatred also has found its way into the representation.

<P>&nbsp;But besides this, there is in the dream a distinct reference to
another train of thoughts which may result in gratification. Some time
before this, after long waiting, a little daughter was born to my friend.
I knew how he had grieved for the sister whom he had lost at an early age,
and I wrote to him that I felt that he would transfer to this child the
love he had felt for her, that this little girl would at last make him
forget his irreparable loss.

<P>&nbsp;Thus this train also connects up with the intermediary thoughts
of the latent dream-content, from which paths radiate in the most contrary
directions: "No one is irreplaceable. See, here are only revenants; all
those whom one has lost return." And now the bonds of association between
the contradictory components of the dream- thoughts are more tightly drawn
by the accidental circumstance that my friend's little daughter bears the
same name as the girl playmate of my own youth, who was just my own age,
and the sister of my oldest friend and antagonist. I heard the name Pauline
with satisfaction, and in order to allude to this coincidence I replaced
one Josef in the dream by another Josef, and found it impossible to suppress
the identical initials in the name Fleischl and Fl. From this point a train
of thought runs to the naming of my own children. I insisted that the names
should not be chosen according to the fashion of the day, but should be
determined by regard for the memory of those dear to us. The children's
names make them revenants. And, finally, is not the procreation of children
for all men the only way of access to immortality?

<P>&nbsp;I shall add only a few observations as to the affects of dreams
considered from another point of view. In the psyche of the sleeper an
affective tendency- what we call a mood- may be contained as its dominating
element, and may induce a corresponding mood in the dream. This mood may
be the result of the experiences and thoughts of the day, or it may be
of somatic origin; in either case it will be accompanied by the corresponding
trains of thought. That this ideational content of the dream-thoughts should
at one time determine the affective tendency primarily, while at another
time it is awakened in a secondary manner by the somatically determined
emotional disposition, is indifferent for the purposes of dream-formation.
This is always subject to the restriction that it can represent only a
wish-fulfilment, and that it may lend its psychic energy to the wish alone.
The mood actually present will receive the same treatment as the sensation
which actually emerges during sleep (Cf. chapter V., C), which is either
neglected or reinterpreted in the sense of a wish-fulfilment. Painful moods
during sleep become the motive force of the dream, inasmuch as they awake
energetic wishes which the dream has to fulfil. The material in which they
inhere is elaborated until it is serviceable for the expression of the
wish-fulfilment. The more intense and the more dominating the element of
the painful mood in the dream-thoughts, the more surely will the most strongly
suppressed wish-impulses take advantage of the opportunity to secure representation;
for thanks to the actual existence of discomfort, which otherwise they
would have to create, they find that the more difficult part of the work
necessary to ensure representation has already been accomplished; and with
these observations we touch once more upon the problem of anxiety- dreams,
which will prove to be the boundary-case of dream- activity.

I. The Secondary Elaboration</H3>
[<I>Psych Web editor's note: in later editions of </I>The Interpretation
of Dreams<I>, this was rendered as "Secondary Revision" with a footnote
saying previous editions used "the somewhat misleading English translation
'secondary elaboration.'"</I>]

<P>&nbsp;We will at last turn our attention to the fourth of the factors
participating in dream-formation.

<P>&nbsp;If we continue our investigation of the dream-content on the lines
already laid down- that is, by examining the origin in the dream-thoughts
of conspicuous occurrences- we come upon elements that can be explained
only by making an entirely new assumption. I have in mind cases where one
manifests astonishment, anger, or resistance in a dream, and that, too,
in respect of part of the dream-content itself. Most of these impulses
of criticism in dreams are not directed against the dream-content, but
prove to be part of the dream-material, taken over and fittingly applied,
as I have already shown by suitable examples. There are, however, criticisms
of this sort which are not so derived: their correlatives cannot be found
in the dream-material. What, for instance, is meant by the criticism not
infrequent in dreams: "After all, it's only a dream"? This is a genuine
criticism of the dream, such as I might make if I were awake, Not infrequently
it is only the prelude to waking; even oftener it is preceded by a painful
feeling, which subsides when the actuality of the dream- state has been
affirmed. The thought: "After all, it's only a dream" in the dream itself
has the same intention as it has on the stage on the lips of Offenbach's
Belle Helene; it seeks to minimize what has just been experienced, and
to secure indulgence for what is to follow. It serves to lull to sleep
a certain mental agency which at the given moment has every occasion to
rouse itself and forbid the continuation of the dream, or the scene. But
it is more convenient to go on sleeping and to tolerate the dream, "because,
after all, it's only a dream." I imagine that the disparaging criticism:
"After all, it's only a dream," appears in the dream at the moment when
the censorship. which is never quite asleep, feels that it has been surprised
by the already admitted dream. It is too late to suppress the dream, and
the agency therefore meets with this remark the anxiety or painful emotion
which rises into the dream. It is an expression of the esprit d'escalier
on the part of the psychic censorship.

<P>&nbsp;In this example we have incontestable proof that everything which
the dream contains does not come from the dream-thoughts, but that a psychic
function, which cannot be differentiated from our waking thoughts, may
make contributions to the dream-content. The question arises, does this
occur only in exceptional cases, or does the psychic agency, which is otherwise
active only as the censorship, play a constant part in dream-formation?

<P>&nbsp;One must decide unhesitatingly for the latter view. It is indisputable
that the censoring agency, whose influence we have so far recognized only
in the restrictions of and omissions in the dream-content, is likewise
responsible for interpolations in and amplifications of this content. Often
these interpolations are readily recognized; they are introduced with hesitation,
prefaced by an "as if"; they have no special vitality of their own, and
are constantly inserted at points where they may serve to connect two portions
of the dream-content or create a continuity between two sections of the
dream. They manifest less ability to adhere in the memory than do the genuine
products of the dream-material; if the dream is forgotten, they are forgotten
first, and I strongly suspect that our frequent complaint that although
we have dreamed so much we have forgotten most of the dream, and have remembered
only fragments, is explained by the immediate falling away of just these
cementing thoughts. In a complete analysis, these interpolations are often
betrayed by the fact that no material is to be found for them in the dream-
thoughts. But after careful examination I must describe this case as the
less usual one; in most cases the interpolated thoughts can be traced to
material in the dream-thoughts which can claim a place in the dream neither
by its own merits nor by way of over- determination. Only in the most extreme
cases does the psychic function in dream-formation which we are now considering
rise to original creation; whenever possible it makes use of anything appropriate
that it can find in the dream-material.

<P>&nbsp;What distinguishes this part of the dream-work, and also betrays
it, is its tendency. This function proceeds in a manner which the poet
maliciously attributes to the philosopher: with its rags and tatters it
stops up the breaches in the structure of the dream. The result of its
efforts is that the dream loses the appearance of absurdity and incoherence,
and approaches the pattern of an intelligible experience. But the effort
is not always crowned with complete success. Thus, dreams occur which may,
upon superficial examination, seem faultlessly logical and correct; they
start from a possible situation, continue it by means of consistent changes,
and bring it- although this is rare- to a not unnatural conclusion. These
dreams have been subjected to the most searching elaboration by a psychic
function similar to our waking thought; they seem to have a meaning, but
this meaning is very far removed from the real meaning of the dream. If
we analyse them, we are convinced that the secondary elaboration has handled
the material with the greatest freedom, and has retained as little as possible
of its proper relations. These are the dreams which have, so to speak,
already been once interpreted before we subject them to waking interpretation.
In other dreams this tendencious elaboration has succeeded only up to a
point; up to this point consistency seems to prevail, but then the dream
becomes nonsensical or confused; but perhaps before it concludes it may
once more rise to a semblance of rationality In yet other dreams the elaboration
has failed completely; we find ourselves helpless, confronted with a senseless
mass of fragmentary contents.

<P>&nbsp;I do not wish to deny to this fourth dream-forming power, which
will soon become familiar to us- it is in reality the only one of the four
dream-creating factors which is familiar to us in other connections- I
do not wish to deny to this fourth factor the faculty of creatively making
new contributions to our dreams. But its influence is certainly exerted,
like that of the other factors, mainly in the preference and selection
of psychic material already formed in the dream-thoughts. Now there is
a case where it is to a great extent spared the work of building, as it
were, a facade to the dream by the fact that such a structure, only waiting
to be used, already exists in the material of the dream-thoughts. I am
accustomed to describe the element of the dream-thoughts which I have in
mind as phantasy; I shall perhaps avoid misunderstanding if I at once point
to the day-dream as an analogy in waking life. * The part played by this
element in our psychic life has not yet been fully recognized and revealed
by psychiatrists; though M. Benedikt has, it seems to me, made a highly
promising beginning. Yet the significance of the day-dream has not escaped
the unerring insight of the poets; we are all familiar with the description
of the day-dreams of one of his subordinate characters which Alphonse Daudet
has given us in his Nabab. The study of the psychoneuroses discloses the
astonishing fact that these phantasies or day-dreams are the immediate
predecessors of symptoms of hysteria- at least, of a great many of them;
for hysterical symptoms are dependent not upon actual memories, but upon
the phantasies built up on a basis of memories. The frequent occurrence
of conscious day-phantasies brings these formations to our ken; but while
some of these phantasies are conscious, there is a super-abundance of unconscious
phantasies, which must perforce remain unconscious on account of their
content and their origin in repressed material. A more thorough examination
of the character of these day- phantasies shows with what good reason the
same name has been given to these formations as to the products of nocturnal
thought- dreams. They have essential features in common with nocturnal
dreams; indeed, the investigation of day-dreams might really have afforded
the shortest and best approach to the understanding of nocturnal dreams.

<P>* Reve, petit roman = day-dream, story.

<P>Like dreams, they are wish-fulfilments; like dreams, they are largely
based upon the impressions of childish experiences; like dreams, they obtain
a certain indulgence from the censorship in respect of their creations.
If we trace their formation, we become aware how the wish-motive which
has been operative in their production has taken the material of which
they are built, mixed it together, rearranged it, and fitted it together
into a new whole. They bear very much the same relation to the childish
memories to which they refer as many of the baroque palaces of Rome bear
to the ancient ruins, whose hewn stones and columns have furnished the
material for the structures built in the modern style.

<P>&nbsp;In the secondary elaboration of the dream-content which we have
ascribed to our fourth dream-forming factor, we find once more the very
same activity which is allowed to manifest itself, uninhibited by other
influences, in the creation of day-dreams. We may say, without further
preliminaries, that this fourth factor of ours seeks to construct something
like a day-dream from the material which offers itself. But where such
a day-dream has already been constructed in the context of the dream-thoughts,
this factor of the dream-work will prefer to take possession of it, and
contrive that it gets into the dream-content. There are dreams that consist
merely of the repetition of a day-phantasy, which has perhaps remained
unconscious- as, for instance, the boy's dream that he is riding in a war-chariot
with the heroes of the Trojan war. In my Autodidasker dream the second
part of the dream at least is the faithful repetition of a day-phantasy-
harmless in itself- of my dealings with Professor N. The fact that the
exciting phantasy forms only a part of the dream, or that only a part of
it finds its way into the dream-content, is due to the complexity of the
conditions which the dream must satisfy at its genesis. On the whole, the
phantasy is treated like any other component of the latent material; but
it is often still recognizable as a whole in the dream. In my dreams there
are often parts which are brought into prominence by their producing a
different impression from that produced by the other parts. They seem to
me to be in a state of flux, to be more coherent and at the same time more
transient than other portions of the same dream. I know that these are
unconscious phantasies which find their way into the context of the dream,
but I have never yet succeeded in registering such a phantasy. For the
rest, these phantasies, like all the other component parts of the dream-
thoughts, are jumbled together, condensed, superimposed, and so on; but
we find all the transitional stages, from the case in which they may constitute
the dream-content, or at least the dream-facade, unaltered, to the most
contrary case, in which they are represented in the dream-content by only
one of their elements, or by a remote allusion to such an element. The
fate of the phantasies in the dream-thoughts is obviously determined by
the advantages they can offer as against the claims of the censorship and
the pressure of condensation.

<P>&nbsp;In my choice of examples for dream-interpretation I have, as far
as possible, avoided those dreams in which unconscious phantasies play
a considerable part, because the introduction of this psychic element would
have necessitated an extensive discussion of the psychology of unconscious
thought. But even in this connection I cannot entirely avoid the phantasy,
because it often finds its way into the dream complete, and still more
often perceptibly glimmers through it. I might mention yet one more dream,
which seems to be composed of two distinct and opposed phantasies, overlapping
here and there, of which the first is superficial, while the second becomes,
as it were, the interpretation of the first. *

<P>* I have analysed an excellent example of a dream of this kind, having
its origin in the stratification of several phantasies, in the Fragment
of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria (Collected Papers, vol. III). I undervalued
the significance of such phantasies for dream-formation as long as I was
working principally on my own dreams, which were rarely based upon day-
dreams but most frequently upon discussions and mental conflicts. With
other persons it is often much easier to prove the complete analogy between
the nocturnal dream and the day-dream. In hysterical patients an attack
may often be replaced by a dream; it is then obvious that the day-dream
phantasy is the first step for both these psychic formations.

<P>The dream- it is the only one of which I possess no careful notes- is
roughly to this effect: The dreamer- a young unmarried man- is sitting
in his favourite inn, which is seen correctly; several persons come to
fetch him, among them someone who wants to arrest him. He says to his table
companions, "I will pay later, I am coming back." But they cry, smiling
scornfully: "We know all about that; that's what everybody says." One guest
calls after him: "There goes another one." He is then led to a small place
where he finds a woman with a child in her arms. One of his escorts says:
"This is Herr Muller." A commissioner or some other official is running
through a bundle of tickets or papers, repeating Muller, Muller, Muller.
At last the commissioner asks him a question, which he answers with a "Yes."
He then takes a look at the woman, and notices that she has grown a large
beard.

<P>&nbsp;The two component parts are here easily separable. What is superficial
is the phantasy of being arrested; this seems to be newly created by the
dream-work. But behind it the phantasy of marriage is visible, and this
material, on the other hand, has been slightly modified by the dream-work,
and the features which may be common to the two phantasies appear with
special distinctness, as in Galton's composite photographs. The promise
of the young man, who is at present a bachelor, to return to his place
at his accustomed table- the scepticism of his drinking companions, made
wise by their many experiences- their calling after him: "There goes (marries)
another one"- are all features easily susceptible of the other interpretation,
as is the affirmative answer given to the official. Running through a bundle
of papers and repeating the same name corresponds to a subordinate but
easily recognized feature of the marriage ceremony- the reading aloud of
the congratulatory telegrams which have arrived at irregular intervals,
and which, of course, are all addressed to the same name. In the personal
appearance of the bride in this dream the marriage phantasy has even got
the better of the arrest phantasy which screens it. The fact that this
bride finally wears a beard I can explain from information received- I
had no opportunity of making an analysis. The dreamer had, on the previous
day, been crossing the street with a friend who was just as hostile to
marriage as himself, and had called his friend's attention to a beautiful
brunette who was coming towards them. The friend had remarked: "Yes, if
only these women wouldn't get beards as they grow older, like their fathers."

<P>&nbsp;Of course, even in this dream there is no lack of elements with
which the dream-distortion has done deep work. Thus, the speech, "I will
pay later," may have reference to the behaviour feared on the part of the
father-in-law in the matter of a dowry. Obviously all sorts of misgivings
are preventing the dreamer from surrendering himself with pleasure to the
phantasy of marriage. One of these misgivings- at with marriage he might
lose his freedom- has embodied itself in the transformation of a scene
of arrest.

<P>&nbsp;If we once more return to the thesis that the dream-work prefers
to make use of a ready-made phantasy, instead of first creating one from
the material of the dream-thoughts, we shall perhaps be able to solve one
of the most interesting problems of the dream. I have related the dream
of Maury, who is struck on the back of the neck by a small board, and wakes
after a long dream- a complete romance of the period of the French Revolution.
Since the dream is produced in a coherent form, and completely fits the
explanation of the waking stimulus, of whose occurrence the sleeper could
have had no forboding, only one assumption seems possible, namely, that
the whole richly elaborated dream must have been composed and dreamed in
the short interval of time between the falling of the board on cervical
vertebrae and the waking induced by the blow. We should not venture to
ascribe such rapidity to the mental operations of the waking state, so
that we have to admit that the dream-work has the privilege of a remarkable
acceleration of its issue.

<P>&nbsp;To this conclusion, which rapidly became popular, more recent
authors (Le Lorrain, Egger, and others) have opposed emphatic objections;
some of them doubt the correctness of Maury's record of the dream, some
seek to show that the rapidity of our mental operations in waking life
is by no means inferior to that which we can, without reservation, ascribe
to the mental operations in dreams. The discussion raises fundamental questions,
which I do not think are at all near solution. But I must confess that
Egger's objections, for example, to Maury's dream of the guillotine, do
not impress me as convincing. I would suggest the following explanation
of this dream: Is it so very improbable that Maury's dream may have represented
a phantasy which had been preserved for years in his memory, in a completed
state, and which was awakened- I should like to say, alluded to- at the
moment when he became aware of the waking stimulus? The whole difficulty
of composing so long a story, with all its details, in the exceedingly
short space of time which is here at the dreamer's disposal then disappears;
the story was already composed. If the board had struck Maury's neck when
he was awake, there would perhaps have been time for the thought: "Why,
that's just like being guillotined." But as he is struck by the board while
asleep, the dream-work quickly utilizes the incoming stimulus for the construction
of a wish-fulfilment, as if it thought (this is to be taken quite figuratively):
"Here is a good opportunity to realize the wish-phantasy which I formed
at such and such a time while I was reading." It seems to me undeniable
that this dream-romance is just such a one as a young man is wont to construct
under the influence of exciting impressions. Who has not been fascinated-
above all, a Frenchman and a student of the history of civilization- by
descriptions of the Reign of Terror, in which the aristocracy, men and
women, the flower of the nation, showed that it was possible to die with
a light heart, and preserved their ready wit and the refinement of their
manners up to the moment of the last fateful summons? How tempting to fancy
oneself in the midst of all this, as one of these young men who take leave
of their ladies with a kiss of the hand, and fearlessly ascend the scaffold!
Or perhaps ambition was the ruling motive of the phantasy- the ambition
to put oneself in the place of one of those powerful personalities who,
by their sheer force of intellect and their fiery eloquence, ruled the
city in which the heart of mankind was then beating so convulsively; who
were impelled by their convictions to send thousands of human beings to
their death, and were paving the way for the transformation of Europe;
who, in the meantime, were not sure of their own heads, and might one day
lay them under the knife of the guillotine, perhaps in the role of a Girondist
or the hero Danton? The detail preserved in the memory of the dream, accompanied
by an enormous crowd, seems to show that Maury's phantasy was an ambitious
one of just this character.

<P>&nbsp;But the phantasy prepared so long ago need not be experienced
again in sleep; it is enough that it should be, so to speak, "touched off."
What I mean is this: If a few notes are struck, and someone says, as in
Don Juan: "That is from The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart," memories suddenly
surge up within me, none of which I can recall to consciousness a moment
later. The phrase serves as a point of irruption from which a complete
whole is simultaneously put into a condition of stimulation. It may well
be the same in unconscious thinking. Through the waking stimulus the psychic
station is excited which gives access to the whole guillotine phantasy.
This phantasy, however, is not run through in sleep, but only in the memory
of the awakened sleeper. Upon waking, the sleeper remembers in detail the
phantasy which was transferred as a whole into the dream. At the same time,
he has no means of assuring himself that he is really remembering something
which was dreamed. The same explanation- namely, that one is dealing with
finished phantasies which have been evoked as wholes by the waking stimulus-
may be applied to other dreams which are adapted to the waking stimulus-
for example, to Napoleon's dream of a battle before the explosion of a
bomb. Among the dreams collected by Justine Tobowolska in her dissertation
on the apparent duration of time in dreams, * I think the most corroborative
is that related by Macario (1857) as having been dreamed by a playwright,
Casimir Bonjour. Bonjour intended one evening to witness the first performance
of one of his own plays, but he was so tired that he dozed off in his chair
behind the scenes just as the curtain was rising. In his sleep he went
through all the five acts of his play, and observed all the various signs
of emotion which were manifested by the audience during each individual
scene. At the close of the performance, to his great satisfaction, he heard
his name called out amidst the most lively manifestations of applause.
Suddenly he woke. He could hardly believe his eyes or his ears; the performance
had not gone beyond the first lines of the first scene; he could not have
been asleep for more than two minutes. As for the dream, the running through
the five acts of the play and the observing the attitude of the public
towards each individual scene need not, we may venture to assert, have
been something new, produced while the dreamer was asleep; it may have
been a repetition of an already completed work of the phantasy. Tobowolska
and other authors have emphasized a common characteristic of dreams that
show an accelerated flow of ideas: namely, that they seem to be especially
coherent, and not at all like other dreams, and that the dreamer's memory
of them is summary rather than detailed. But these are precisely the characteristics
which would necessarily be exhibited by ready-made phantasies touched off
by the dream- work- a conclusion which is not, of course, drawn by these
authors. I do not mean to assert that all dreams due to a waking stimulus
admit of this explanation, or that the problem of the accelerated flux
of ideas in dreams is entirely disposed of in this manner.

<P>* Justine Tobowolska, Etude sur les illusions de temps dans les reves
du sommeil normal (1900) p. 53.

<P>And here we are forced to consider the relation of this secondary elaboration
of the dream-content to the other factors of the dream-work. May not the
procedure perhaps be as follows? The dream-forming factors, the efforts
at condensation, the necessity of evading the censorship, and the regard
for representability by the psychic means of the dream first of all create
from the dream- material a provisional dream-content, which is subsequently
modified until it satisfies as far as possible the exactions of a secondary
agency. No, this is hardly probable. We must rather assume that the requirements
of this agency constitute from the very first one of the conditions which
the dream must satisfy, and that this condition, as well as the conditions
of condensation, the opposing censorship, and representability, simultaneously
influence, in an inductive and selective manner, the whole mass of material
in the dream-thoughts. But of the four conditions necessary for dream-formation,
the last recognized is that whose exactions appear to be least binding
upon the dream. The following consideration makes it seem very probable
that this psychic function, which undertakes the so-called secondary elaboration
of the dream-content, is identical with the work of our waking thought:
Our waking (preconscious) thought behaves towards any given perceptual
material precisely as the function in question behaves towards the dream-content.
It is natural to our waking thought to create order in such material, to
construct relations, and to subject it to the requirements of an intelligible
coherence. Indeed, we go rather too far in this respect; the tricks of
conjurers befool us by taking advantage of this intellectual habit of ours.
In the effort to combine in an intelligible manner the sensory impressions
which present themselves we often commit the most curious mistakes, and
even distort the truth of the material before us. The proofs of this fact
are so familiar that we need not give them further consideration here.
We overlook errors which make nonsense of a printed page because we imagine
the proper words. The editor of a widely read French journal is said to
have made a bet that he could print the words from in front or from behind
in every sentence of a long article without any of his readers noticing
it. He won his bet. Years ago I came across a comical example of false
association in a newspaper. After the session of the French Chamber in
which Dupuy quelled the panic, caused by the explosion of a bomb thrown
by an anarchist, with the courageous words, "La seance continue," * the
visitors in the gallery were asked to testify as to their impressions of
the outrage. Among them were two provincials. One of these said that immediately
after the end of a speech he had heard a detonation, but that he had thought
that it was the parliamentary custom to fire a shot whenever a speaker
had finished. The other, who had apparently already listened to several
speakers, had got hold of the same idea, but with this variation, that
he supposed the shooting to be a sign of appreciation following a specially
successful speech.

<P>* The meeting will continue.

<P>Thus, the psychic agency which approaches the dream-content with the
demand that it must be intelligible, which subjects it to a first interpretation,
and in doing so leads to the complete misunderstanding of it, is none other
than our normal thought. In our interpretation the rule will be, in every
case, to disregard the apparent coherence of the dream as being of suspicious
origin and, whether the elements are confused or clear, to follow the same
regressive path to the dream-material.

<P>&nbsp;At the same time, we note those factors upon which the above-
mentioned (chapter VI., C) scale of quality in dreams- from confusion to
clearness- is essentially independent. Those parts of the dream seem to
us clear in which the secondary elaboration has been able to accomplish
something; those seem confused where the powers of this performance have
failed. Since the confused parts of the dream are often likewise those
which are less vividly presented, we may conclude that the secondary dream-work
is responsible also for a contribution to the plastic intensity of the
individual dream-structures.

<P>&nbsp;If I seek an object of comparison for the definitive formation
of the dream, as it manifests itself with the assistance of normal thinking,
I can think of none better than those mysterious inscriptions with which
Die Fliegende Blatter has so long amused its readers. In a certain sentence
which, for the sake of contrast, is in dialect, and whose significance
is as scurrilous as possible, the reader is led to expect a Latin inscription.
For this purpose the letters of the words are taken out of their syllabic
groupings, and are rearranged. Here and there a genuine Latin word results;
at other points, on the assumption that letters have been obliterated by
weathering, or omitted, we allow ourselves to be deluded about the significance
of certain isolated and meaningless letters. If we do not wish to be fooled
we must give up looking for an inscription, must take the letters as they
stand, and combine them, disregarding their arrangement, into words of
our mother tongue.

<P>&nbsp;The secondary elaboration is that factor of the dream-work which
has been observed by most of the writers on dreams, and whose importance
has been duly appreciated. Havelock Ellis gives an amusing allegorical
description of its performances: "As a matter of fact, we might even imagine
the sleeping consciousness as saying to itself: 'Here comes our master,
Waking Consciousness, who attaches such mighty importance to reason and
logic and so forth. Quick! gather things up, put them in order- any order
will do- before he enters to take possession.'" *

<P>* The World of Dreams, pp. 10, 11 (London, 1911).

<P>The identity of this mode of operation with that of waking thought is
very clearly stated by Delacroix in his Sur la structure logique du reve
(p. 526): "Cette fonction d'interpretation n'est pas particuliere au reve;
c'est le meme travail de coordination logique que nous faisons sur nos
sensations pendant la veille." *

<P>* This function of interpretation is not particular to the dream; it
is the same work of logical coordination that we use on our sensations
when awake.

<P>J. Sully is of the same opinion; and so is Tobowolska: "Sur ces successions
incoherentes d'hallucinations, l'esprit s'efforce de faire le meme travail
de coordination logique qu'il fait pendant le veille sur les sensations.
Il relie entre elles par un lien imaginaire toutes ces images decousues
et bouche les ecarts trop grands qui se trouvaient entre elles" * (p. 93).

<P>* With these series of incoherent halucinations, the mind must do the
same work of logical coordination that it does with the sensations when
awake. With a bon of imagination, it reunites all the disconnected images,
and fills in the gaps found which are too great.

<P>Some authors maintain that this ordering and interpreting activity begins
even in the dream and is continued in the waking state. Thus Paulhan (p.
547): "Cependant j'ai souvent pense qu'il pouvait y avoir une certain deformation,
ou plutot reformation du reve dans le souvenir.... La tendence systematisante
de l'imagination pourrait fort bien achever apres le reveil ce qu'elle
a ebauche pendant le sommeil. De la sorte, la rapidite reelle de la pensee
serait augmentee en apparence par les perfectionnements dus a l'imagination
eveillee." *

<P>* However, I have often thought that there might be a certain deformation,
or rather reformation, of the dream when it is recalled.... The systematizing
tendency of the imagination can well finish, after waking, the sketch begun
in sleep. In that way, the real speed of thought will be augmented in appearance
by improvements due to the wakened imagination.

<P>Leroy and Tobowolska (p. 502): "Dans le reve, au contraire, l'interpretation
et la coordination se font non seulement a l'aide des donnees du reve,
mais encore a l'aide de celles de la veille...." *

<P>* In the dream, on the contrary, the interpretation and coordination
are made not only with the aid of what is given by the dream, but also
with what is given by the wakened mind.

<P>It was therefore inevitable that this one recognized factor of dream-formation
should be over-estimated, so that the whole process of creating the dream
was attributed to it. This creative work was supposed to be accomplished
at the moment of waking, as was assumed by Goblot, and with deeper conviction
by Foucault, who attributed to waking thought the faculty of creating the
dream out of the thoughts which emerged in sleep.

<P>&nbsp;In respect to this conception, Leroy and Tobowolska express themselves
as follows: "On a cru pouvoir placer le reve au moment du reveil et ils
ont attribue a la pensee de la veille la fonction de construire le reve
avec les images presentes dans la pensee du sommeil." *

<P>* It was thought that the dream could be placed at the moment of waking,
and they attributed to the waking thoughts the function of constructing
the dream from the images present in the sleeping thoughts.

<P>To this estimate of the secondary elaboration I will add the one fresh
contribution to the dream-work which has been indicated by the sensitive
observations of H. Silberer. Silberer has caught the transformation of
thoughts into images in flagranti, by forcing himself to accomplish intellectual
work while in a state of fatigue and somnolence. The elaborated thought
vanished, and in its place there appeared a vision which proved to be a
substitute for- usually abstract- thoughts. In these experiments it so
happened that the emerging image, which may be regarded as a dream-element,
represented something other than the thoughts which were waiting for elaboration:
namely, the exhaustion itself, the difficulty or distress involved in this
work; that is, the subjective state and the manner of functioning of the
person exerting himself rather than the object of his exertions. Silberer
called this case, which in him occurred quite often, the functional phenomenon,
in contradistinction to the material phenomenon which he expected.

<P>&nbsp;"For example: one afternoon I am lying, extremely sleepy, on my
sofa, but I nevertheless force myself to consider a philosophical problem.
I endeavour to compare the views of Kant and Schopenhauer concerning time.
Owing to my somnolence I do not succeed in holding on to both trains of
thought, which would have been necessary for the purposes of comparison.
After several vain efforts, I once more exert all my will-power to formulate
for myself the Kantian deduction in order to apply it to Schopenhauer's
statement of the problem. Thereupon, I directed my attention to the latter,
but when I tried to return to Kant, I found that he had again escaped me,
and I tried in vain to fetch him back. And now this fruitless endeavour
to rediscover the Kantian documents mislaid somewhere in my head suddenly
presented itself, my eyes being closed, as in a dream-image, in the form
of a visible, plastic symbol: I demand information of a grumpy secretary,
who, bent over a desk, does not allow my urgency to disturb him; half straightening
himself, he gives me a look of angry refusal." *

<P>Other examples, which relate to the fluctuation between sleep and waking:

<P>&nbsp;"Example No. 2. Conditions: Morning, while awaking. While to a
certain extent asleep (crepuscular state), thinking over a previous dream,
in a way repeating and finishing it, I feel myself drawing nearer to the
waking state, yet I wish to remain in the crepuscular state. .."Scene:
I am stepping with one foot over a stream, but I at once pull it back again
and resolve to remain on this side." *

<P>* Jahrb., iii, p. 625.

<P>"Example No. 6. Conditions the same as in Example No. 4 (he wishes to
remain in bed a little longer without oversleeping). I wish to indulge
in a little longer sleep. .."Scene: I am saying good-bye to somebody, and
I agree to meet him (or her) again before long."

<P>&nbsp;I will now proceed to summarize this long disquisition on the
dream-work. We were confronted by the question whether in dream- formation
the psyche exerts all its faculties to their full extent, without inhibition,
or only a fraction of them, which are restricted in their action. Our investigations
lead us to reject such a statement of the problem as wholly inadequate
in the circumstances. But if, in our answer, we are to remain on the ground
upon which the question forces us, we must assent to two conceptions which
are apparently opposed and mutually exclusive. The psychic activity in
dream-formation resolves itself into two achievements: the production of
the dream-thoughts and the transformation of these into the dream-content.
The dream- thoughts are perfectly accurate, and are formed with all the
psychic profusion of which we are capable; they belong to the thoughts
which have not become conscious, from which our conscious thoughts also
result by means of a certain transposition. There is doubtless much in
them that is worth knowing, and also mysterious, but these problems have
no particular relation to our dreams, and cannot claim to be treated under
the head of dream-problems. * On the other hand, we have the process which
changes the unconscious thoughts into the dream- content, which is peculiar
to the dream-life and characteristic of it. Now, this peculiar dream-work
is much farther removed from the pattern of waking thought than has been
supposed by even the most decided depreciators of the psychic activity
in dream- formation. It is not so much that it is more negligent, more
incorrect, more forgetful, more incomplete than waking thought; it is something
altogether different, qualitatively, from waking thought, and cannot therefore
be compared with it. It does not think, calculate, or judge at all, but
limits itself to the work of transformation. It may be exhaustively described
if we do not lose sight of the conditions which its product must satisfy.
This product, the dream, has above all to be withdrawn from the censorship,
and to this end the dream-work makes use of the displacement of psychic
intensities, even to the transvaluation of all psychic values; thoughts
must be exclusively or predominantly reproduced in the material of visual
and acoustic memory-traces, and from this requirement there proceeds the
regard of the dream-work for representability, which it satisfies by fresh
displacements. Greater intensities have (probably) to be produced than
are at the disposal of the night dream-thoughts, and this purpose is served
by the extensive condensation to which the constituents of the dream-thoughts
are subjected. Little attention is paid to the logical relations of the
thought- material; they ultimately find a veiled representation in the
formal peculiarities of the dream. The affects of the dream- thoughts undergo
slighter alterations than their conceptual content. As a rule, they are
suppressed; where they are preserved, they are freed from the concepts
and combined in accordance with their similarity. Only one part of the
dream-work- the revision, variable in amount, which is effected by the
partially wakened conscious thought- is at all consistent with the conception
which the writers on the subject have endeavoured to extend to the whole
performance of dream-formation.

<P>* Formerly I found it extraordinarily difficult to accustom my readers
to the distinction between the manifest dream-content and the latent dream-thoughts.
Over and over again arguments and objections were adduced from the uninterpreted
dream as it was retained in the memory, and the necessity of interpreting
the dream was ignored. But now, when the analysts have at least become
reconciled to substituting for the manifest dream its meaning as found
by interpretation, many of them are guilty of another mistake, to which
they adhere just as stubbornly. They look for the essence of the dream
in this latent content, and thereby overlook the distinction between latent
dream-thoughts and the dream-work. The dream is fundamentally nothing more
than a special form of our thinking, which is made possible by the conditions
of the sleeping state. It is the dream-work which produces this form, and
it alone is the essence of dreaming- the only explanation of its singularity.
I say this in order to correct the reader's judgment of the notorious prospective
tendency of dreams. That the dream should concern itself with efforts to
perform the tasks with which our psychic life is confronted is no more
remarkable than that our conscious waking life should so concern itself,
and I will only add that this work may be done also in the preconscious,
a fact already familiar to us.
