C. The Wish-Fulfilment</H3>
The dream of the burning child (cited above) affords us a welcome opportunity
for appreciating the difficulties confronting the theory of wish-fulfilment.
That a dream should be nothing but a wish-fulfilment must undoubtedly seem
strange to us all- and not only because of the contradiction offered by
the anxiety-dream. Once our first analyses had given us the enlightenment
that meaning and psychic value are concealed behind our dreams, we could
hardly have expected so unitary a determination of this meaning. According
to the correct but summary definition of Aristotle, the dream is a continuation
of thinking in sleep. Now if, during the day, our thoughts perform such
a diversity of psychic acts- judgments, conclusions, the answering of objections,
expectations, intentions, etc.- why should they be forced at night to confine
themselves to the production of wishes only? Are there not, on the contrary,
many dreams that present an altogether different psychic act in dream-form-
for example, anxious care- and is not the father's unusually transparent
dream of the burning child such a dream? From the gleam of light that falls
upon his eyes while he is asleep the father draws the apprehensive conclusion
that a candle has fallen over and may be burning the body; he transforms
this conclusion into a dream by embodying it in an obvious situation enacted
in the present tense. What part is played in this dream by the wish-fulfilment?
And how can we possibly mistake the predominance of the thought continued
from the waking state or evoked by the new sensory impression?

<P>&nbsp;All these considerations are justified, and force us to look more
closely into the role of the wish-fulfilment in dreams, and the significance
of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.

<P>&nbsp;It is precisely the wish-fulfilment that has already caused us
to divide all dreams into two groups. We have found dreams which were plainly
wish-fulfilments; and others in which the wish- fulfilment was unrecognizable
and was often concealed by every available means. In this latter class
of dreams we recognized the influence of the dream-censorship. The undisguised
wish-dreams were found chiefly in children; short, frank wish-dreams seemed
(I purposely emphasize this word) to occur also in adults.

<P>&nbsp;We may now ask whence in each case does the wish that is realized
in the dream originate? But to what opposition or to what diversity do
we relate this whence? I think to the opposition between conscious daily
life and an unconscious psychic activity which is able to make itself perceptible
only at night. I thus, find a threefold possibility for the origin of a
wish. Firstly, it may have been excited during the day, and owing to external
circumstances may have remained unsatisfied; there is thus left for the
night an acknowledged and unsatisfied wish. Secondly, it may have emerged
during the day, only to be rejected; there is thus left for the night an
unsatisfied but suppressed wish. Thirdly, it may have no relation to daily
life, but may belong to those wishes which awake only at night out of the
suppressed material in us. If we turn to our scheme of the psychic apparatus,
we can localize a wish of the first order in the system Pcs. We may assume
that a wish of the second order has been forced back from the Pcs system
into the Ucs system, where alone, if anywhere, can it maintain itself;
as for the wish- impulse of the third order, we believe that it is wholly
incapable of leaving the Ucs system. Now, have the wishes arising from
these different sources the same value for the dream, the same power to
incite a dream?

<P>&nbsp;On surveying the dreams at our disposal with a view to answering
this question, we are at once moved to add as a fourth source of the dream-wish
the actual wish-impetus which arises during the night (for example, the
stimulus of thirst, and sexual desire). It then seems to us probable that
the source of the dream-wish does not affect its capacity to incite a dream.
I have in mind the dream of the child who continued the voyage that had
been interrupted during the day, and the other children's dreams cited
in the same chapter; they are explained by an unfulfilled but unsuppressed
wish of the daytime. That wishes suppressed during the day assert themselves
in dreams is shown by a great many examples. I will mention a very simple
dream of this kind. A rather sarcastic lady, whose younger friend has become
engaged to be married, is asked in the daytime by her acquaintances whether
she knows her friend's fiance, and what she thinks of him. She replies
with unqualified praise, imposing silence on her own judgment, although
she would have liked to tell the truth, namely, that he is a commonplace
fellow- one meets such by the dozen (Dutzendmensch). The following night
she dreams that the same question is put to her, and that she replies with
the formula: "In case of subsequent orders, it will suffice to mention
the reference number." Finally, as the result of numerous analyses, we
learn that the wish in all dreams that have been subject to distortion
has its origin in the unconscious, and could not become perceptible by
day. At first sight, then, it seems that in respect of dream-formation
all wishes are of equal value and equal power.

<P>&nbsp;I cannot prove here that this is not really the true state of
affairs, but I am strongly inclined to assume a stricter determination
of the dream-wish. Children's dreams leave us in no doubt that a wish unfulfilled
during the day may instigate a dream. But we must not forget that this
is, after all, the wish of a child; that it is a wish-impulse of the strength
peculiar to childhood. I very much doubt whether a wish unfulfilled in
the daytime would suffice to create a dream in an adult. It would rather
seem that, as we learn to control our instinctual life by intellection,
we more and more renounce as unprofitable the formation or retention of
such intense wishes as are natural to childhood. In this, indeed, there
may be individual variations; some retain the infantile type of the psychic
processes longer than others; just as we find such differences in the gradual
decline of the originally vivid visual imagination. In general, however,
I am of the opinion that unfulfilled wishes of the day are insufficient
to produce a dream in adults. I will readily admit that the wish-impulses
originating in consciousness contribute to the instigation of dreams, but
they probably do no more. The dream would not occur if the preconscious
wish were not reinforced from another source.

<P>&nbsp;That source is the unconscious. I believe that the conscious wish
becomes effective in exciting a dream only when it succeeds in arousing
a similar unconscious wish which reinforces it. From the indications obtained
in the psychoanalysis of the neuroses, I believe that these unconscious
wishes are always active and ready to express themselves whenever they
find an opportunity of allying themselves with an impulse from consciousness,
and transferring their own greater intensity to the lesser intensity of
the latter. * It must, therefore, seem that the conscious wish alone has
been realized in the dream; but a slight peculiarity in the form of the
dream will put us on the track of the powerful ally from the unconscious.
These ever-active and, as it were, immortal wishes of our unconscious recall
the legendary Titans who, from time immemorial, have been buried under
the mountains which were once hurled upon them by the victorious gods,
and even now quiver from time to time at the convulsions of their mighty
limbs. These wishes, existing in repression, are themselves of infantile
origin, as we learn from the psychological investigation of the neuroses.
Let me, therefore, set aside the view previously expressed, that it matters
little whence the dream-wish originates, and replace it by another, namely:
the wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile wish. In the adult
it originates in the Ucs, while in the child, in whom no division and censorship
exist as yet between the Pcs and Ucs, or in whom these are only in process
of formation, it is an unfulfilled and unrepressed wish from the waking
state. I am aware that this conception cannot be generally demonstrated,
but I maintain that it can often be demonstrated even where one would not
have suspected it, and that it cannot be generally refuted. -

<P>* They share this character of indestructibility with all other psychic
acts that are really unconscious- that is, with psychic acts belonging
solely to the system Ucs. These paths are opened once and for all; they
never fall into disease; they conduct the excitation process to discharge
as often as they are charged again with unconscious excitation. To speak
metaphorically, they suffer no other form of annihilation than did the
shades of the lower regions in the Odyssey, who awoke to new life the moment
they drank blood. The processes depending on the preconscious system are
destructible in quite another sense. The psychotherapy of the neuroses
is based on this difference.

<P>In dream-formation, the wish-impulses which are left over from the conscious
waking life are, therefore, to be relegated to the background. I cannot
admit that they play any part except that attributed to the material of
actual sensations during sleep in relation to the dream-content. If I now
take into account those other psychic instigations left over from the waking
life of the day, which are not wishes, I shall merely be adhering to the
course mapped out for me by this line of thought. We may succeed in provisionally
disposing of the energetic cathexis of our waking thoughts by deciding
to go to sleep. He is a good sleeper who can do this; Napoleon I is reputed
to have been a model of this kind. But we do not always succeed in doing
it, or in doing it completely. Unsolved problems, harassing cares, overwhelming
impressions, continue the activity of our thought even during sleep, maintaining
psychic processes in the system which we have termed the preconscious.
The thought-impulses continued into sleep may be divided into the following
groups:

<P>1. Those which have not been completed during the day, owing to some
accidental cause.

<P>&nbsp;2. Those which have been left uncompleted because our mental powers
have failed us, i.e., unsolved problems.

<P>&nbsp;3. Those which have been turned back and suppressed during the
day. This is reinforced by a powerful fourth group:

<P>&nbsp;4. Those which have been excited in our Ucs during the day by
the workings of the Pcs; and finally we may add a fifth, consisting of:

<P>&nbsp;5. The indifferent impressions of the day, which have therefore
been left unsettled.

<P>We need not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep
by these residues of the day's waking life, especially those emanating
from the group of the unsolved issues. It is certain that these excitations
continue to strive for expression during the night, and we may assume with
equal certainty that the state of sleep renders impossible the usual continuance
of the process of excitation in the preconscious and its termination in
becoming conscious. In so far as we can become conscious of our mental
processes in the ordinary way, even during the night, to that extent we
are simply not asleep. I cannot say what change is produced in the Pcs
system by the state of sleep, * but there is no doubt that the psychological
characteristics of sleep are to be sought mainly in the cathectic changes
occurring just in this system, which dominates, moreover, the approach
to motility, paralysed during sleep. On the other hand, I have found nothing
in the psychology of dreams to warrant the assumption that sleep produces
any but secondary changes in the conditions of the Ucs system. Hence, for
the nocturnal excitations in the Pcs there remains no other path than that
taken by the wish-excitations from the Ucs; they must seek reinforcement
from the Ucs, and follow the detours of the unconscious excitations. But
what is the relation of the preconscious day-residues to the dream? There
is no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream; that they utilize
the dream-content to obtrude themselves upon consciousness even during
the night; indeed, they sometimes even dominate the dream-content, and
impel it to continue the work of the day; it is also certain that the day-residues
may just as well have any other character as that of wishes. But it is
highly instructive, and for the theory of wish-fulfilment of quite decisive
importance, to see what conditions they must comply with in order to be
received into the dream.

<P>* I have endeavoured to penetrate farther into the relations of the
sleeping state and the conditions of hallucination in my essay, "Metapsychological
Supplement to the Theory of Dreams," Collected Papers, IV, p. 137.

<P>Let us pick out one of the dreams cited above, e.g., the dream in which
my friend Otto seems to show the symptoms of Basedow's disease (chapter
V., D). Otto's appearance gave me some concern during the day, and this
worry, like everything else relating to him, greatly affected me. I may
assume that this concern followed me into sleep. I was probably bent on
finding out what was the matter with him. During the night my concern found
expression in the dream which I have recorded. Not only was its content
senseless, but it failed to show any wish-fulfilment. But I began to search
for the source of this incongruous expression of the solicitude felt during
the day, and analysis revealed a connection. I identified my friend Otto
with a certain Baron L and myself with a Professor R. There was only one
explanation of my being impelled to select just this substitute for the
day- thought. I must always have been ready in the Ucs to identify myself
with Professor R, as this meant the realization of one of the immortal
infantile wishes, viz., the wish to become great. Repulsive ideas respecting
my friend, ideas that would certainly have been repudiated in a waking
state, took advantage of the opportunity to creep into the dream; but the
worry of the day had likewise found some sort of expression by means of
a substitute in the dream-content. The day-thought, which was in itself
not a wish, but on the contrary a worry, had in some way to find a connection
with some infantile wish, now unconscious and suppressed, which then allowed
it- duly dressed up- to arise for consciousness. The more domineering the
worry the more forced could be the connection to be established; between
the content of the wish and that of the worry there need be no connection,
nor was there one in our example.

<P>&nbsp;It would perhaps be appropriate, in dealing with this problem,
to inquire how a dream behaves when material is offered to it in the dream-thoughts
which flatly opposes a wish-fulfilment; such as justified worries, painful
reflections and distressing realizations. The many possible results may
be classified as follows: (a) The dream-work succeeds in replacing all
painful ideas by contrary ideas. and suppressing the painful affect belonging
to them. This, then, results in a pure and simple satisfaction-dream, a
palpable wish-fulfilment, concerning which there is nothing more to be
said. (b) The painful ideas find their way into the manifest dream-content,
more or less modified, but nevertheless quite recognizable. This is the
case which raises doughts about the wish-theory of dreams, and thus calls
for further investigation. Such dreams with a painful content may either
be indifferent in feeling, or they may convey the whole painful affect,
which the ideas contained in them seem to justify, or they may even lead
to the development of anxiety to the point of waking.

<P>&nbsp;Analysis then shows that even these painful dreams are wish- fulfilments.
An unconscious and repressed wish, whose fulfilment could only be felt
as painful by the dreamer's ego, has seized the opportunity offered by
the continued cathexis of painful day- residues, has lent them its support,
and has thus made them capable of being dreamed. But whereas in case (a)
the unconscious wish coincided with the conscious one, in case (b) the
discord between the unconscious and the conscious- the repressed material
and the ego- is revealed, and the situation in the fairy-tale, of the three
wishes which the fairy offers to the married couple, is realized (see p.
534 below). The gratification in respect of the fulfilment of the repressed
wish may prove to be so great that it balances the painful affects adhering
to the day-residues; the dream is then indifferent in its affective tone,
although it is on the one hand the fulfilment of a wish, and on the other
the fulfilment of a fear. Or it may happen that the sleeper's ego plays
an even more extensive part in the dream-formation, that it reacts with
violent resentment to the accomplished satisfaction of the repressed wish,
and even goes so far as to make an end of the dream by means of anxiety.
It is thus not difficult to recognize that dreams of pain and anxiety are,
in accordance with our theory, just as much wish-fulfilments as are the
straightforward dreams of gratification.

<P>&nbsp;Painful dreams may also be punishment dreams. It must be admitted
that the recognition of these dreams adds something that is, in a certain
sense, new to the theory of dreams. What is fulfilled by them is once more
an unconscious wish- the wish for the punishment of the dreamer for a repressed,
prohibited wish- impulse. To this extent, these dreams comply with the
requirement here laid down: that the motive-power behind the dream-formation
must be furnished by a wish belonging to the unconscious. But a finer psychological
dissection allows us to recognize the difference between this and the other
wish-dreams. In the dreams of group (b) the unconscious dream-forming wish
belonged to the repressed material. In the punishment-dreams it is likewise
an unconscious wish, but one which we must attribute not to the repressed
material but to the ego.

<P>&nbsp;Punishment-dreams point, therefore, to the possibility of a still
more extensive participation of the ego in dream-formation. The mechanism
of dream-formation becomes indeed in every way more transparent if in place
of the antithesis conscious and unconscious, we put the antithesis: ego
and repressed. This, however, cannot be done without taking into account
what happens in the psychoneuroses, and for this reason it has not been
done in this book. Here I need only remark that the occurrence of punishment-dreams
is not generally subject to the presence of painful day-residues. They
originate, indeed, most readily if the contrary is true, if the thoughts
which are day-residues are of a gratifying nature, but express illicit
gratifications. Of these thoughts nothing, then, finds its way into the
manifest dream except their contrary, just as was the case in the dreams
of group (a). Thus it would be the essential characteristic of punishment-dreams
that in them it is not the unconscious wish from the repressed material
(from the system Ucs) that is responsible for dream-formation but the punitive
wish reacting against it, a wish pertaining to the ego, even though it
is unconscious (i.e., preconscious). *

<P>* Here one may consider the idea of the super-ego which was later recognized
by psycho-analysis.

<P>I will elucidate some of the foregoing observations by means of a dream
of my own, and above all I will try to show how the dream- work deals with
a day-residue involving painful expectation:

<P>&nbsp;Indistinct beginning. I tell my wife I have some news for her,
something very special. She becomes frightened, and does not wish to hear
it. I assure her that on the contrary it is something which will please
her greatly, and I begin to tell her that our son's Officers' Corps has
sent a sum of money (5,000 k.?)... something about honourable mention...
distribution... at the same time I have gone with her into a sitting room,
like a store-room, in order to fetch something from it. Suddenly I see
my son appear; he is not in uniform but rather in a tight-fitting sports
suit (like a seal?) with a small cap. He climbs on to a basket which stands
to one side near a chest, in order to put something on this chest. I address
him; no answer. It seems to me that his face or forehead is bandaged, he
arranges something in his mouth, pushing something into it. Also his hair
shows a glint of grey. I reflect: Can he be so exhausted? And has he false
teeth? Before I can address him again I awake without anxiety, but with
palpitations. My clock points to 2.30 a.m.

<P>&nbsp;To give a full analysis is once more impossible. I shall therefore
confine myself to emphasizing some decisive points. Painful expectations
of the day had given occasion for this dream; once again there had been
no news for over a week from my son, who was fighting at the Front. It
is easy to see that in the dream-content the conviction that he has been
killed or wounded finds expression. At the beginning of the dream one can
observe an energetic effort to replace the painful thoughts by their contrary.
I have to impart something very pleasing, something about sending money,
honourable mention, and distribution. (The sum of money originates in a
gratifying incident of my medical practice; it is therefore trying to lead
the dream away altogether from its theme.) But this effort fails. The boy's
mother has a presentiment of something terrible and does not wish to listen.
The disguises are too thin; the reference to the material to be suppressed
shows through everywhere. If my son is killed, then his comrades will send
back his property; I shall have to distribute whatever he has left among
his sisters, brothers and other people. Honourable mention is frequently
awarded to an officer after he has died the "hero's death." The dream thus
strives to give direct expression to what it at first wished to deny, whilst
at the same time the wish-fulfilling tendency reveals itself by distortion.
(The change of locality in the dream is no doubt to be understood as threshold
symbolism, in line with Silberer's view.) We have indeed no idea what lends
it the requisite motive-power. But my son does not appear as failing (on
the field of battle) but climbing.- He was, in fact, a daring mountaineer.-
He is not in uniform, but in a sports suit; that is, the place of the fatality
now dreaded has been taken by an accident which happened to him at one
time when he was ski- running, when he fell and fractured his thigh. But
the nature of his costume, which makes him look like a seal, recalls immediately
a younger person, our comical little grandson; the grey hair recalls his
father, our son-in-law, who has had a bad time in the War. What does this
signify? But let us leave this: the locality, a pantry, the chest, from
which he wants to take something (in the dream, to put something on it),
are unmistakable allusions to an accident of my own, brought upon myself
when I was between two and three years of age. I climbed on a foot-stool
in the pantry, in order to get something nice which was on a chest or table.
The footstool tumbled over and its edge struck me behind the lower jaw.
I might very well have knocked all my teeth out. At this point, an admonition
presents itself: it serves you right- like a hostile impulse against the
valiant warrior. A profounder analysis enables me to detect the hidden
impulse, which would be able to find satisfaction in the dreaded mishap
to my son. It is the envy of youth which the elderly man believes that
he has thoroughly stifled in actual life. There is no mistaking the fact
that it was the very intensity of the painful apprehension lest such a
misfortune should really happen that searched out for its alleviation such
a repressed wish-fulfilment.

<P>&nbsp;I can now clearly define what the unconscious wish means for the
dream. I will admit that there is a whole class of dreams in which the
incitement originates mainly or even exclusively from the residues of the
day; and returning to the dream about my friend Otto, I believe that even
my desire to become at last a professor extraordinarius would have allowed
me to sleep in peace that night, had not the day's concern for my friend's
health continued active. But this worry alone would not have produced a
dream; the motive-power needed by the dream had to be contributed by a
wish, and it was the business of my concern to find such a wish for itself,
as the motive power of the dream. To put it figuratively, it is quite possible
that a day-thought plays the part of the entrepreneur in the dream; but
the entrepreneur, who, as we say, has the idea, and feels impelled to realize
it, can do nothing without capital; he needs a capitalist who will defray
the expense, and this capitalist, who contributes the psychic expenditure
for the dream, is invariably and indisputably, whatever the nature of the
waking thoughts, a wish from the unconscious.

<P>&nbsp;In other cases the capitalist himself is the entrepreneur; this,
indeed, seems to be the more usual case. An unconscious wish is excited
by the day's work, and this now creates the dream. And the dream-processes
provide a parallel for all the other possibilities of the economic relationship
here used as an illustration. Thus the entrepreneur may himself contribute
a little of the capital, or several entrepreneurs may seek the aid of the
same capitalist, or several capitalists may jointly supply the capital
required by the entrepreneurs. Thus there are dreams sustained by more
than one dream-wish, and many similar variations, which may be readily
imagined, and which are of no further interest to us. What is still lacking
to our discussion of the dream-wish we shall only be able to complete later
on.

<P>&nbsp;The tertium comparationis in the analogies here employed, the
quantitative element of which an allotted amount is placed at the free
disposal of the dream, admits of a still closer application to the elucidation
of the dream-structure. As shown in chapter VI., B., we can recognize in
most dreams a centre supplied with a special sensory intensity. This is,
as a rule, the direct representation of the wish-fulfilment; for, if we
reverse the displacements of the dream-work, we find that the psychic intensity
of the elements in the dream-thoughts is replaced by the sensory intensity
of the elements in the dream-content. The elements in the neighbourhood
of the wish-fulfilment have often nothing to do with its meaning, but prove
to be the offshoots of painful thoughts which are opposed to the wish.
But owing to their connection with the central element, often artificially
established, they secure so large a share of its intensity as to become
capable of representation. Thus, the representative energy of the wish-fulfilment
diffuses itself over a certain sphere of association, within which all
elements are raised to representation, including even those that are in
themselves without resources. In dreams containing several dynamic wishes
we can easily separate and delimit the spheres of the individual wish-fulfilments,
and we shall find that the gaps in the dream are often of the nature of
boundary-zones.

<P>&nbsp;Although the foregoing remarks have restricted the significance
of the day-residues for the dream, they are none the less deserving of
some further attention. For they must be a necessary ingredient in dream-formation,
inasmuch as experience reveals the surprising fact that every dream shows
in its content a connection with a recent waking impression, often of the
most indifferent kind. So far we have failed to understand the necessity
for this addition to the dream-mixture (chapter V., A.). This necessity
becomes apparent only when we bear in mind the part played by the unconscious
wish, and seek further information in the psychology of the neuroses. We
shall then learn that an unconscious idea, as such, is quite incapable
of entering into the preconscious, and that it can exert an influence there
only by establishing touch with a harmless idea already belonging to the
preconscious, to which it transfers its intensity, and by which it allows
itself to be screened. This is the fact of transference, which furnishes
the explanation of so many surprising occurrences in the psychic life of
neurotics. The transference may leave the idea from the preconscious unaltered,
though the latter will thus acquire an unmerited intensity, or it may force
upon this some modification derived from the content of the transferred
idea. I trust the reader will pardon my fondness for comparisons with daily
life, but I feel tempted to say that the situation for the repressed idea
is like that of the American dentist in Austria, who may not carry on his
practice unless he can get a duly installed doctor of medicine to serve
him as a signboard and legal "cover." Further, just as it is not exactly
the busiest physicians who form such alliances with dental practitioners,
so in the psychic life the choice as regards covers for repressed ideas
does not fall upon such preconscious or conscious ideas as have themselves
attracted enough of the attention active in the preconscious. The unconscious
prefers to entangle with its connections either those impressions and ideas
of the preconscious which have remained unnoticed as being indifferent
or those which have immediately had attention withdrawn from them again
(by rejection). it is a well-known proposition of the theory of associations,
confirmed by all experience, that ideas which have formed a very intimate
connection in one direction assume a negative type of attitude towards
whole groups of new connections. I have even attempted at one time to base
a theory of hysterical paralysis on this principle.

<P>&nbsp;If we assume that the same need of transference on the part of
the repressed ideas, of which we have become aware through the analysis
of the neurosis, makes itself felt in dreams also, we can at once explain
two of the problems of the dream: namely, that every dream-analysis reveals
an interweaving of a recent impression, and that this recent element is
often of the most indifferent character. We may add what we have already
learned elsewhere, that the reason why these recent and indifferent elements
so frequently find their way into the dream-content as substitutes for
the very oldest elements of the dream-thoughts is that they have the least
to fear from the resisting censorship. But while this freedom from censorship
explains only the preference shown to the trivial elements, the constant
presence of recent elements points to the necessity for transference. Both
groups of impressions satisfy the demand of the repressed ideas for material
still free from associations, the indifferent ones because they have offered
no occasion for extensive associations, and the recent ones because they
have not had sufficient time to form such associations.

<P>&nbsp;We thus see that the day-residues, among which we may now include
the indifferent impressions, not only borrow something from the Ucs when
they secure a share in dream-formation- namely, the motive-power at the
disposal of the repressed wish- but they also offer to the unconscious
something that is indispensable to it, namely, the points of attachment
necessary for transference. If we wished to penetrate more deeply into
the psychic processes, we should have to throw a clearer light on the play
of excitations between the preconscious and the unconscious, and indeed
the study of the psychoneuroses would impel us to do so; but dreams, as
it happens, give us no help in this respect.

<P>&nbsp;Just one further remark as to the day-residues. There is no doubt
that it is really these that disturb our sleep, and not our dreams which,
on the contrary, strive to guard our sleep. But we shall return to this
point later.

<P>&nbsp;So far we have discussed the dream-wish; we have traced it back
to the sphere of the Ucs, and have analysed its relation to the day-residues,
which, in their turn, may be either wishes, or psychic impulses of any
other kind, or simply recent impressions. We have thus found room for the
claims that can be made for the dream-forming significance of our waking
mental activity in all its multifariousness. It might even prove possible
to explain, on the basis of our train of thought, those extreme cases in
which the dream, continuing the work of the day, brings to a happy issue
an unsolved problem of waking life. We merely lack a suitable example to
analyse, in order to uncover the infantile or repressed source of wishes,
the tapping of which has so successfully reinforced the efforts of the
preconscious activity. But we are not a step nearer to answering the question:
Why is it that the unconscious can furnish in sleep nothing more than the
motive-power for a wish-fulfilment? The answer to this question must elucidate
the psychic nature of the state of wishing: and it will be given with the
aid of the notion of the psychic apparatus.

<P>&nbsp;We do not doubt that this apparatus, too, has only arrived at
its present perfection by a long process of evolution. Let us attempt to
restore it as it existed in an earlier stage of capacity. From postulates
to be confirmed in other ways, we know that at first the apparatus strove
to keep itself as free from stimulation as possible, and therefore, in
its early structure, adopted the arrangement of a reflex apparatus, which
enabled it promptly to discharge by the motor paths any sensory excitation
reaching it from without. But this simple function was disturbed by the
exigencies of life, to which the apparatus owes the impetus toward further
development. The exigencies of life first confronted it in the form of
the great physical needs. The excitation aroused by the inner need seeks
an outlet in motility, which we may describe as internal change or expression
of the emotions. The hungry child cries or struggles helplessly. But its
situation remains unchanged; for the excitation proceeding from the inner
need has not the character of a momentary impact, but of a continuing pressure.
A change can occur only if, in some way (in the case of the child by external
assistance), there is an experience of satisfaction, which puts an end
to the internal excitation. An essential constituent of this experience
is the appearance of a certain percept (of food in our example), the memory-image
of which is henceforth associated with the memory- trace of the excitation
arising from the need. Thanks to the established connection, there results,
at the next occurrence of this need, a psychic impulse which seeks to revive
the memory- image of the former percept, and to re-evoke the former percept
itself; that is, it actually seeks to re-establish the situation of the
first satisfaction. Such an impulse is what we call a wish; the reappearance
of the perception constitutes the wish- fulfilment, and the full cathexis
of the perception, by the excitation springing from the need, constitutes
the shortest path to the wish-fulfilment. We may assume a primitive state
of the psychic apparatus in which this path is actually followed, i.e.,
in which the wish ends in hallucination. This first psychic activity therefore
aims at an identity of perception: that is, at a repetition of that perception
which is connected with the satisfaction of the need.

<P>&nbsp;This primitive mental activity must have been modified by bitter
practical experience into a secondary and more appropriate activity. The
establishment of identity of perception by the short regressive path within
the apparatus does not produce the same result in another respect as follows
upon cathexis of the same perception coming from without. The satisfaction
does not occur, and the need continues. In order to make the internal cathexis
equivalent to the external one, the former would have to be continuously
sustained, just as actually happens in the hallucinatory psychoses and
in hunger-phantasies, which exhaust their performance in maintaining their
hold on the object desired. In order to attain to more appropriate use
of the psychic energy, it becomes necessary to suspend the full regression,
so that it does not proceed beyond the memory-image, and thence can seek
other paths, leading ultimately to the production of the desired identity
from the side of the outer world. * This inhibition, as well as the subsequent
deflection of the excitation, becomes the task of a second system, which
controls voluntary motility, i.e., a system whose activity first leads
on to the use of motility for purposes remembered in advance. But all this
complicated mental activity, which works its way from the memory-image
to the production of identity of perception via the outer world, merely
represents a roundabout way to wish-fulfilment made necessary by experience.
*(2) Thinking is indeed nothing but a substitute for the hallucinatory
wish; and if the dream is called a wish-fulfilment, this becomes something
self-evident, since nothing but a wish can impel our psychic apparatus
to activity. The dream, which fulfils its wishes by following the short
regressive path, has thereby simply preserved for us a specimen of the
primary method of operation of the psychic apparatus, which has been abandoned
as inappropriate. What once prevailed in the waking state, when our psychic
life was still young and inefficient, seems to have been banished into
our nocturnal life; just as we still find in the nursery those discarded
primitive weapons of adult humanity, the bow and arrow. Dreaming is a fragment
of the superseded psychic life of the child. In the psychoses, those modes
of operation of the psychic apparatus which are normally suppressed in
the waking state reassert themselves, and thereupon betray their inability
to satisfy our demands in the outer world. *(3)

<P>* In other words: the introduction of a test of reality is recognized
as necessary.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) Le Lorrain justly extols the wish-fulfilments of dreams:
"Sans fatigue serieuse, sans etre oblige de recourir a cette lutte opiniatre
et longue qui use et corrode les jouissances poursuivies." [Without serious
fatigue, without being obliged to have recourse to that long and stubborn
struggle which exhausts and wears away pleasures sought.]

<P>&nbsp;*(3) I have further elaborated this train of thought elsewhere,
where I have distinguished the two principles involved as the pleasure-principle
and the reality-principle. Formulations regarding the Two Principles in
Mental Functioning, in Collected Papers, Vol. iv. p. 13.

<P>The unconscious wish-impulses evidently strive to assert themselves
even during the day, and the fact of transference, as well as the psychoses,
tells us that they endeavour to force their way through the preconscious
system to consciousness and the command of motility. Thus, in the censorship
between Ucs and Pcs, which the dream forces us to assume, we must recognize
and respect the guardian of our psychic health. But is it not carelessness
on the part of this guardian to diminish his vigilance at night, and to
allow the suppressed impulses of the Ucs to achieve expression, thus again
making possible the process of hallucinatory regression? I think not, for
when the critical guardian goes to rest- and we have proof that his slumber
is not profound- he takes care to close the gate to motility. No matter
what impulses from the usually inhibited Ucs may bustle about the stage,
there is no need to interfere with them; they remain harmless, because
they are not in a position to set in motion the motor apparatus which alone
can operate to produce any change in the outer world. Sleep guarantees
the security of the fortress which has to be guarded. The state of affairs
is less harmless when a displacement of energies is produced, not by the
decline at night in the energy put forth by the critical censorship, but
by the pathological enfeeblement of the latter, or the pathological reinforcement
of the unconscious excitations, and this while the preconscious is cathected
and the gates of motility are open. The guardian is then overpowered; the
unconscious excitations subdue the Pcs, and from the Pcs they dominate
our speech and action, or they enforce hallucinatory regressions, thus
directing an apparatus not designed for them by virtue of the attraction
exerted by perceptions on the distribution of our psychic energy. We call
this condition psychosis.

<P>&nbsp;We now find ourselves in the most favourable position for continuing
the construction of our psychological scaffolding, which we left after
inserting the two systems, Ucs and Pcs. However, we still have reason to
give further consideration to the wish as the sole psychic motive-power
in the dream. We have accepted the explanation that the reason why the
dream is in every case a wish-fulfilment is that it is a function of the
system Ucs, which knows no other aim than wish-fulfilment, and which has
at its disposal no forces other than the wish-impulses. Now if we want
to continue for a single moment longer to maintain our right to develop
such far-reaching psychological speculations from the facts of dream-interpretation,
we are in duty bound to show that they insert the dream into a context
which can also embrace other psychic structures. If there exists a system
of the Ucs- or something sufficiently analogous for the purposes of our
discussion- the dream cannot be its sole manifestation; every dream may
be a wish-fulfilment, but there must be other forms of abnormal wish-fulfilment
as well as dreams. And in fact the theory of all psychoneurotic symptoms
culminates in the one proposition that they, too, must be conceived as
wish-fulfilments of the unconscious. * Our explanation makes the dream
only the first member of a series of the greatest importance for the psychiatrist,
the understanding of which means the solution of the purely psychological
part of the psychiatric problem. *(2) But in other members of this group
of wish-fulfilments- for example, in the hysterical symptoms- I know of
one essential characteristic which I have so far failed to find in the
dream. Thus, from the investigations often alluded to in this treatise,
I know that the formation of an hysterical symptom needs a junction of
both the currents of our psychic life. The symptom is not merely the expression
of a realized unconscious wish; the latter must be joined by another wish
from the preconscious, which is fulfilled by the same symptom; so that
the symptom is at least doubly determined, once by each of the conflicting
systems. Just as in dreams, there is no limit to further over- determination.
The determination which does not derive from the Ucs is, as far as I can
see, invariably a thought-stream of reaction against the unconscious wish;
for example, a self- punishment. Hence I can say, quite generally, that
an hysterical symptom originates only where two contrary wish-fulfilments,
having their source in different psychic systems, are able to meet in a
single expression. *(3) Examples would help us but little here, as nothing
but a complete unveiling of the complications in question can carry conviction.
I will therefore content myself with the bare assertion, and will cite
one example, not because it proves anything, but simply as an illustration.
The hysterical vomiting of a female patient proved, on the one hand, to
be the fulfilment of an unconscious phantasy from the years of puberty-
namely, the wish that she might be continually pregnant, and have a multitude
of children; and this was subsequently supplemented by the wish that she
might have them by as many fathers as possible. Against this immoderate
wish there arose a powerful defensive reaction. But as by the vomiting
the patient might have spoilt her figure and her beauty, so that she would
no longer find favour in any man's eyes, the symptom was also in keeping
with the punitive trend of thought, and so, being admissible on both sides,
it was allowed to become a reality. This is the same way of acceding to
a wish-fulfilment as the queen of the Parthians was pleased to adopt in
the case of the triumvir Crassus. Believing that he had undertaken his
campaign out of greed for gold, she caused molten gold to be poured into
the throat of the corpse. "Here thou hast what thou hast longed for!"

<P>* Expressed more exactly: One portion of the symptom corresponds to
the unconscious wish-fulfilment, while the other corresponds to the reaction-formation
opposed to it.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) Hughlings Jackson has expressed himself as follows: "Find
out all about dreams, and you will have found out all about insanity."

<P>&nbsp;*(3) Cf. my latest formulation (in Zeitschrift fur Sexual- wissenschaft,
Bd. I) of the origin of hysterical symptoms in the treatise on "Hysterical
Phantasies and their Relation to Bisexuality," Collected Papers, II, p.
51. This forms chapter X of Selected Papers on Hysteria, p. 115 above.

<P>Of the dream we know as yet only that it expresses a wish- fulfilment
of the unconscious; and apparently the dominant preconscious system permits
this fulfilment when it has compelled the wish to undergo certain distortions.
We are, moreover, not in fact in a position to demonstrate regularly the
presence of a train of thought opposed to the dream-wish, which is realized
in the dream as well as its antagonist. Only now and then have we found
in dream-analyses signs of reaction-products as, for instance, my affection
for my friend R in the dream of my uncle (chapter IV.). But the contribution
from the preconscious which is missing here may be found in another place.
The dream can provide expression for a wish from the Ucs by means of all
sorts of distortions, once the dominant system has withdrawn itself into
the wish to sleep, and has realized this wish by producing the changes
of cathexis within the psychic apparatus which are within its power; thereupon
holding on to the wish in question for the whole duration of sleep. *

<P>* This idea has been borrowed from the theory of sleep of Liebault,
who revived hypnotic research in modern times (Du Sommeil provoque, etc.,
Paris [1889]).

<P>Now this persistent wish to sleep on the part of the preconscious has
a quite general facilitating effect on the formation of dreams. Let us
recall the dream of the father who, by the gleam of light from the death-chamber,
was led to conclude that his child's body might have caught fire. We have
shown that one of the psychic forces decisive in causing the father to
draw this conclusion in the dream instead of allowing himself to be awakened
by the gleam of light was the wish to prolong the life of the child seen
in the dream by one moment. Other wishes originating in the repressed have
probably escaped us, for we are unable to analyse this dream. But as a
second source of motive- power in this dream we may add the father's desire
to sleep, for, like the life of the child, the father's sleep is prolonged
for a moment by the dream. The underlying motive is: "Let the dream go
on, or I must wake up." As in this dream, so in all others, the wish to
sleep lends its support to the unconscious wish. In chapter III. we cited
dreams which were manifestly dreams of convenience. But in truth all dreams
may claim this designation. The efficacy of the wish to go on sleeping
is most easily recognized in the awakening dreams, which so elaborate the
external sensory stimulus that it becomes compatible with the continuance
of sleep; they weave it into a dream in order to rob it of any claims it
might make as a reminder of the outer world. But this wish to go on sleeping
must also play its part in permitting all other dreams, which can only
act as disturbers of the state of sleep from within. "Don't worry; sleep
on; it's only a dream," is in many cases the suggestion of the Pcs to consciousness
when the dream gets too bad; and this describes in a quite general way
the attitude of our dominant psychic activity towards dreaming, even though
the thought remains unuttered. I must draw the conclusion that throughout
the whole of our sleep we are just as certain that we are dreaming as we
are certain that we are sleeping. It is imperative to disregard the objection
that our consciousness is never directed to the latter knowledge, and that
it is directed to the former knowledge only on special occasions, when
the censorship feels, as it were, taken by surprise. On the contrary, there
are persons in whom the retention at night of the knowledge that they are
sleeping and dreaming becomes quite manifest, and who are thus apparently
endowed with the conscious faculty of guiding their dream-life. Such a
dreamer, for example, is dissatisfied with the turn taken by a dream; he
breaks it off without waking, and begins it afresh, in order to continue
it along different lines, just like a popular author who, upon request,
gives a happier ending to his play. Or on another occasion, when the dream
places him in a sexually exciting situation, he thinks in his sleep: "I
don't want to continue this dream and exhaust myself by an emission; I
would rather save it for a real situation."

<P>&nbsp;The Marquis Hervey (Vaschide) declared that he had gained such
power over his dreams that he could accelerate their course at will, and
turn them in any direction he wished. It seems that in him the wish to
sleep had accorded a place to another, a preconscious wish, the wish to
observe his dreams and to derive pleasure from them. Sleep is just as compatible
with such a wish- resolve as it is with some proviso as a condition of
waking up (wet-nurse's sleep), We know, too, that in all persons an interest
in dreams greatly increases the number of dreams remembered after waking.

<P>&nbsp;Concerning other observations as to the guidance of dreams, Ferenczi
states: "The dream takes the thought that happens to occupy our psychic
life at the moment, and elaborates it from all sides. It lets any given
dream-picture drop when there is a danger that the wish-fulfilment will
miscarry, and attempts a new kind of solution, until it finally succeeds
in creating a wish- fulfilment that satisfies in one compromise both instances
of the psychic life."

D. Waking Caused by Dreams -- The Function of Dreams -- The Anxiety Dream</H2>
Now that we know that throughout the night the preconscious is orientated
to the wish to sleep, we can follow the dream-process with proper understanding.
But let us first summarize what we already know about this process. We
have seen that day-residues are left over from the waking activity of the
mind, residues from which it has not been possible to withdraw all cathexis.
Either one of the unconscious wishes has been aroused through the waking
activity during the day or it so happens that the two coincide; we have
already discussed the multifarious possibilities. Either already during
the day or only on the establishment of the state of sleep the unconscious
wish has made its way to the day- residues, and has effected a transference
to them. Thus there arises a wish transferred to recent material; or the
suppressed recent wish is revived by a reinforcement from the unconscious.
This wish now endeavours to make its way to consciousness along the normal
path of the thought processes, through the preconscious, to which indeed
it belongs by virtue of one of its constituent elements. It is, however,
confronted by the censorship which still subsists, and to whose influence
it soon succumbs. It now takes on the distortion for which the way has
already been paved by the transference to recent material. So far it is
on the way to becoming something resembling an obsession, a delusion, or
the like, i.e., a thought reinforced by a transference, and distorted in
expression owing to the censorship. But its further progress is now checked
by the state of sleep of the preconscious; this system has presumably protected
itself against invasion by diminishing its excitations. The dream-process,
therefore, takes the regressive course, which is just opened up by the
peculiarity of the sleeping state, and in so doing follows the attraction
exerted on it by memory- groups, which are, in part only, themselves present
as visual cathexis, not as translations into the symbols of the later systems.
On its way to regression it acquires representability. The subject of compression
will be discussed later. The dream- process has by this time covered the
second part of its contorted course. The first part threads its way progressively
from the unconscious scenes or phantasies to the preconscious, while the
second part struggles back from the boundary of the censorship to the tract
of the perceptions. But when the dream-process becomes a perception-content,
it has, so to speak, eluded the obstacle set up in the Pcs by the censorship
and the sleeping state. It succeeds in drawing attention to itself, and
in being remarked by consciousness. For consciousness, which for us means
a sense- organ for the apprehension of psychic qualities, can be excited
in waking life from two sources: firstly, from the periphery of the whole
apparatus, the perceptive system; and secondly, from the excitations of
pleasure and pain which emerge as the sole psychic qualities yielded by
the transpositions of energy in the interior of the apparatus. All other
processes in the Psi- systems, even those in the preconscious, are devoid
of all psychic quality, and are therefore not objects of consciousness,
inasmuch as they do not provide either pleasure or pain for its perception.
We shall have to assume that these releases of pleasure and pain automatically
regulate the course of the cathectic processes. But in order to make possible
more delicate performances, it subsequently proved necessary to render
the flow of ideas more independent of pain-signals. To accomplish this,
the Pcs system needed qualities of its own which could attract consciousness,
and most probably received them through the connection of the preconscious
processes with the memory-system of speech-symbols, which was not devoid
of quality. Through the qualities of this system, consciousness, hitherto
only a sense- organ for perceptions, now becomes also a sense-organ for
a part of our thought-processes. There are now, as it were, two sensory
surfaces, one turned toward perception and the other toward the preconscious
thought-processes.

<P>&nbsp;I must assume that the sensory surface of consciousness which
is turned to the preconscious is rendered far more unexcitable by sleep
than the surface turned toward the P-system. The giving up of interest
in the nocturnal thought-process is, of course, an appropriate procedure.
Nothing is to happen in thought; the preconscious wants to sleep. But once
the dream becomes perception, it is capable of exciting consciousness through
the qualities now gained. The sensory excitation performs what is in fact
its function; namely, it directs a part of the cathectic energy available
in the Pcs to the exciting cause in the form of attention. We must therefore
admit that the dream always has a waking effect- that is, it calls into
activity part of the quiescent energy of the Pcs. Under the influence of
this energy, it now undergoes the process which we have described as secondary
elaboration with a view to coherence and comprehensibility. This means
that the dream is treated by this energy like any other perception-content;
it is subjected to the same anticipatory ideas as far, at least, as the
material allows. As far as this third part of the dream-process has any
direction, this is once more progressive.

<P>&nbsp;To avoid misunderstanding, it will not be amiss to say a few words
as to the temporal characteristics of these dream- processes. In a very
interesting discussion, evidently suggested by Maury's puzzling guillotine
dream, Goblot tries to demonstrate that a dream takes up no other time
than the transition period between sleeping and waking. The process of
waking up requires time; during this time the dream occurs. It is supposed
that the final picture of the dream is so vivid that it forces the dreamer
to wake; in reality it is so vivid only because when it appears the dreamer
is already very near waking. "Un reve, c'est un reveil qui commence." *

<P>* A dream is the beginning of wakening.

<P>It has already been pointed out by Dugas that Goblot, in order to generalize
his theory, was forced to ignore a great many facts. There are also dreams
from which we do not awaken; for example, many dreams in which we dream
that we dream. From our knowledge of the dream-work, we can by no means
admit that it extends only over the period of waking. On the contrary,
we must consider it probable that the first part of the dream-work is already
begun during the day, when we are still under the domination of the preconscious.
The second phase of the dream-work, viz., the alteration by the censorship,
the attraction exercised by unconscious scenes, and the penetration to
perception, continues probably all through the night, and accordingly we
may always be correct when we report a feeling that we have been dreaming
all night, even although we cannot say what we have dreamed. I do not however,
think that it is necessary to assume that up to the time of becoming conscious
the dream-processes really follow the temporal sequence which we have described;
viz., that there is first the transferred dream-wish, then the process
of distortion due to the censorship, and then the change of direction to
regression, etc. We were obliged to construct such a sequence for the sake
of description; in reality, however, it is probably rather a question of
simultaneously trying this path and that, and of the excitation fluctuating
to and fro, until finally, because it has attained the most apposite concentration,
one particular grouping remains in the field. Certain personal experiences
even incline me to believe that the dream-work often requires more than
one day and one night to produce its result, in which case the extraordinary
art manifested in the construction of the dream is shorn of its miraculous
character. In my opinion, even the regard for the comprehensibility of
the dream as a perceptual event may exert its influence before the dream
attracts consciousness to itself. From this point, however, the process
is accelerated, since the dream is henceforth subjected to the same treatment
as any other perception. It is like fire works, which require hours for
their preparation and then flare up in a moment.

<P>&nbsp;Through the dream-work, the dream-process now either gains sufficient
intensity to attract consciousness to itself and to arouse the preconscious
(quite independently of the time or profundity of sleep), or its intensity
is insufficient, and it must wait in readiness until attion, becoming more
alert immediately before waking, meets it half-way. Most dreams seem to
operate with relatively slight psychic intensities, for they wait for the
process of waking. This, then, explains the fact that as a rule we perceive
something dreamed if we are suddenly roused from a deep sleep. Here, as
well as in spontaneous waking, our first glance lights upon the perception-content
created by the dream-work, while the next falls on that provided by the
outer world.

<P>&nbsp;But of greater theoretical interest are those dreams which are
capable of waking us in the midst of our sleep. We may bear in mind the
purposefulness which can be demonstrated in all other cases, and ask ourselves
why the dream, that is, the unconscious wish, is granted the power to disturb
our sleep, i.e., the fulfilment of the preconscious wish. The explanation
is probably to be found in certain relations of energy which we do not
yet understand. If we did so, we should probably find that the freedom
given to the dream and the expenditure upon it of a certain detached attention
represent a saving of energy as against the alternative case of the unconscious
having to be held in check at night just as it is during the day. As experience
shows, dreaming, even if it interrupts our sleep several times a night,
still remains compatible with sleep. We wake up for a moment, and immediately
fall asleep again. It is like driving off a fly in our sleep; we awake
ad hoc. When we fall asleep again we have removed the cause of disturbance.
The familiar examples of the sleep of wet-nurses, etc., show that the fulfilment
of the wish to sleep is quite compatible with the maintenance of a certain
amount of attention in a given direction.

<P>&nbsp;But we must here take note of an objection which is based on a
greater knowledge of the unconscious processes. We have ourselves described
the unconscious wishes as always active, whilst nevertheless asserting
that in the daytime they are not strong enough to make themselves perceptible.
But when the state of sleep supervenes, and the unconscious wish has shown
its power to form a dream, and with it to awaken the preconscious, why
does this power lapse after cognizance has been taken of the dream? Would
it not seem more probable that the dream should continually renew itself,
like the disturbing fly which, when driven away, takes pleasure in returning
again and again? What justification have we for our assertion that the
dream removes the disturbance to sleep?

<P>&nbsp;It is quite true that the unconscious wishes are always active.
They represent paths which are always practicable, whenever a quantum of
excitation makes use of them. It is indeed an outstanding peculiarity of
the unconscious processes that they are indestructible. Nothing can be
brought to an end in the unconscious; nothing is past or forgotten. This
is impressed upon us emphatically in the study of the neuroses, and especially
of hysteria. The unconscious path of thought which leads to the discharge
through an attack is forthwith passable again when there is a sufficient
accumulation of excitation. The mortification suffered thirty years ago
operates, after having gained access to the unconscious sources of affect,
during all these thirty years as though it were a recent experience. Whenever
its memory is touched, it revives, and shows itself to be cathected with
excitation which procures a motor discharge for itself in an attack. It
is precisely here that psychotherapy must intervene, its task being to
ensure that the unconscious processes are settled and forgotten. Indeed,
the fading of memories and the weak affect of impressions which are no
longer recent, which we are apt to take as self-evident, and to explain
as a primary effect of time on our psychic memory-residues, are in reality
secondary changes brought about by laborious work. It is the preconscious
that accomplishes this work; and the only course which psychotherapy can
pursue is to bring the Ucs under the dominion of the Pcs.

<P>&nbsp;There are, therefore, two possible issues for any single unconscious
excitation-process. Either it is left to itself, in which case it ultimately
breaks through somewhere and secures, on this one occasion, a discharge
for its excitation into motility, or it succumbs to the influence of the
preconscious, and through this its excitation becomes bound instead of
being discharged. It is the latter case that occurs in the dream-process.
The cathexis from the Pcs which goes to meet the dream once this has attained
to perception, because it has been drawn thither by the excitation of consciousness,
binds the unconscious excitation of the dream and renders it harmless as
a disturber of sleep. When the dreamer wakes up for a moment, he has really
chased away the fly that threatened to disturb his sleep. We may now begin
to suspect that it is really more expedient and economical to give way
to the unconscious wish, to leave clear its path to regression so that
and it may form a dream, and then to bind and dispose of this dream by
means of a small outlay of preconscious work, than to hold the unconscious
in check throughout the whole period of sleep. It was, indeed, to be expected
that the dream, even if originally it was not a purposeful process, would
have seized upon some definite function in the play of forces of the psychic
life. We now see what this function is. The dream has taken over the task
of bringing the excitation of the Ucs, which had been left free, back under
the domination of the preconscious; it thus discharges the excitation of
the Ucs, acts as a safety-valve for the latter, and at the same time, by
a slight outlay of waking activity, secures the sleep of the preconscious.
Thus, like the other psychic formations of its group, the dream offers
itself as a compromise, serving both systems simultaneously, by fulfilling
the wishes of both, in so far as they are mutually compatible. A glance
at Robert's "elimination theory" will show that we must agree with this
author on his main point, namely, the determination of the function of
dreams, though we differ from him in our general presuppositions and in
our estimation of the dream-process. * -

<P>* Is this the only function which we can attribute to dreams? I know
of no other. A. Maeder, to be sure, has endeavoured to claim for the dream
yet other secondary functions. He started from the just observation that
many dreams contain attempts to provide solutions of conflicts, which are
afterwards actually carried through. They thus behave like preparatory
practice for waking activities. He therefore drew a parallel between dreaming
and the play of animals and children, which is to be conceived as a training
of the inherited instincts, and a preparation for their later serious activity,
thus setting up a fonction ludique for the dream. A little while before
Maeder, Alfred Adler likewise emphasized the function of thinking ahead
in the dream. (An analysis which I published in 1905 contained a dream
which may be conceived as a resolution-dream, which was repeated night
after night until it was realized.)

<P>&nbsp;But an obvious reflection must show us that this secondary function
of the dream has no claim to recognition within the framework of any dream-interpretation.
Thinking ahead, making resolutions, sketching out attempted solutions which
can then perhaps be realized in waking life- these and many more performances
are functions of the unconscious and preconscious activities of the mind
which continue as day-residues in the sleeping state, and can then combine
with an unconscious wish to form a dream (chapter VII., C.). The function
of thinking ahead in the dream is thus rather a function of preconscious
waking thought, the result of which may be disclosed to us by the analysis
of dreams or other phenomena. After the dream has so long been fused with
its manifest content, one must now guard against confusing it with the
latent dream-thoughts.

<P>The above qualification- in so far as the two wishes are mutually compatible-
contains a suggestion that there may be cases in which the function of
the dream fails. The dream-process is, to begin with, admitted as a wish-fulfilment
of the unconscious, but if this attempted wish-fulfilment disturbs the
preconscious so profoundly that the latter can no longer maintain its state
of rest, the dream has broken the compromise, and has failed to perform
the second part of its task. It is then at once broken off, and replaced
by complete awakening. But even here it is not really the fault of the
dream if, though at other times the guardian, it has now to appear as the
disturber of sleep, nor need this prejudice us against its averred purposive
character. This is not the only instance in the organism in which a contrivance
that is usually to the purpose becomes inappropriate and disturbing so
soon as something is altered in the conditions which engender it; the disturbance,
then, at all events serves the new purpose of indicating the change, and
of bringing into play against it the means of adjustment of the organism.
Here, of course, I am thinking of the anxiety-dream, and lest it should
seem that I try to evade this witness against the theory of wish- fulfilment
whenever I encounter it, I will at least give some indications as to the
explanation of the anxiety-dream.

<P>&nbsp;That a psychic process which develops anxiety may still be a wish-
fulfilment has long ceased to imply any contradiction for us. We may explain
this occurrence by the fact that the wish belongs to one system (the Ucs),
whereas the other system (the Pcs) has rejected and suppressed it. * The
subjection of the Ucs by the Pcs is not thoroughgoing even in perfect psychic
health; the extent of this suppression indicates the degree of our psychic
normality. Neurotic symptoms indicate to us that the two systems are in
mutual conflict; the symptoms are the result of a compromise in this conflict,
and they temporarily put an end to it. On the one hand, they afford the
Ucs a way out for the discharge of its excitation- they serve it as a kind
of sally- gate- while, on the other hand, they give the Pcs the possibility
of dominating the Ucs in some degree. It is instructive to consider, for
example, the significance of a hysterical phobia, or of agoraphobia. A
neurotic is said to be incapable of crossing the street alone, and this
we should rightly call a symptom. Let someone now remove this symptom by
constraining him to this action which he deems himself incapable of performing.
The result will be an attack of anxiety, just as an attack of anxiety in
the street has often been the exciting cause of the establishment of an
agoraphobia. We thus learn that the symptom has been constituted in order
to prevent the anxiety from breaking out. The phobia is thrown up before
the anxiety like a frontier fortress.

<P>* General Introduction to Psycho-Analysis, p. 534 below.

<P>We cannot enlarge further on this subject unless we examine the role
of the affects in these processes, which can only be done here imperfectly.
We will therefore affirm the proposition that the principal reason why
the suppression of the Ucs becomes necessary is that, if the movement of
ideas in the Ucs were allowed to run its course, it would develop an affect
which originally had the character of pleasure, but which, since the process
of repression, bears the character of pain. The aim, as well as the result,
of the suppression is to prevent the development of this pain. The suppression
extends to the idea- content of the Ucs, because the liberation of pain
might emanate from this idea-content. We here take as our basis a quite
definite assumption as to the nature of the development of affect. This
is regarded as a motor or secretory function, the key to the innervation
of which is to be found in the ideas of the Ucs. Through the domination
of the Pcs these ideas are as it were strangled, that is, inhibited from
sending out the impulse that would develop the affect. The danger which
arises, if cathexis by the Pcs ceases, thus consists in the fact that the
unconscious excitations would liberate an affect that- in consequence of
the repression that has previously occurred- could only be felt as pain
or anxiety.

<P>&nbsp;This danger is released if the dream-process is allowed to have
its own way. The conditions for its realization are that repressions shall
have occurred, and that the suppressed wish- impulses can become sufficiently
strong. They, therefore, fall entirely outside the psychological framework
of dream-formation. Were it not for the fact that our theme is connected
by just one factor with the theme of the development of anxiety, namely,
by the setting free of the Ucs during sleep, I could refrain from the discussion
of the anxiety-dream altogether, and thus avoid all the obscurities involved
in it.

<P>&nbsp;The theory of the anxiety-dream belongs, as I have already repeatedly
stated, to the psychology of the neuroses. I might further add that anxiety
in dreams is an anxiety-problem and not a dream-problem. Having once exhibited
the point of contact of the psychology of the neuroses with the theme of
the dream- process, we have nothing further to do with it. There is only
one thing left which I can do. Since I have asserted that neurotic anxiety
has its origin in sexual sources, I can subject anxiety- dreams to analysis
in order to demonstrate the sexual material in their dream-thoughts.

<P>&nbsp;For good reasons, I refrain from citing any of the examples so
abundantly placed at my disposal by neurotic patients, and prefer to give
some anxiety-dreams of children.

<P>&nbsp;Personally, I have had no real anxiety-dream for decades, but
I do recall one from my seventh or eighth year which I subjected to interpretation
some thirty years later. The dream was very vivid, and showed me my beloved
mother, with a peculiarly calm, sleeping countenance, carried into the
room and laid on the bed by two (or three) persons with birds' beaks. I
awoke crying and screaming, and disturbed my parents' sleep. The peculiarly
draped, excessively tall figures with beaks I had taken from the illustrations
of Philippson's Bible; I believe they represented deities with the heads
of sparrowhawks from an Egyptian tomb- relief. The analysis yielded, however,
also the recollection of a house-porter's boy, who used to play with us
children on a meadow in front of the house; I might add that his name was
Philip. It seemed to me then that I first heard from this boy the vulgar
word signifying sexual intercourse, which is replaced among educated persons
by the Latin word coitus, but which the dream plainly enough indicates
by the choice of the birds' heads. I must have guessed the sexual significance
of the word from the look of my worldly-wise teacher. My mother's expression
in the dream was copied from the countenance of my grandfather, whom I
had seen a few days before his death snoring in a state of coma. The interpretation
of the secondary elaboration in the dream must therefore have been that
my mother was dying; the tomb-relief, too, agrees with this. I awoke with
this anxiety, and could not calm myself until I had waked my parents. I
remember that I suddenly became calm when I saw my mother; it was as though
I had needed the assurance: then she was not dead. But this secondary interpretation
of the dream had only taken place when the influence of the developed anxiety
was already at work. I was not in a state of anxiety because I had dreamt
that my mother was dying; I interpreted the dream in this manner in the
preconscious elaboration because I was already under the domination of
the anxiety. The latter, however, could be traced back, through the repression
to a dark, plainly sexual craving, which had found appropriate expression
in the visual content of the dream.

<P>&nbsp;A man twenty-seven years of age, who had been seriously ill for
a year, had repeatedly dreamed, between the ages of eleven and thirteen,
dreams attended with great anxiety, to the effect that a man with a hatchet
was running after him; he wanted to run away, but seemed to be paralysed,
and could not move from the spot. This may be taken as a good and typical
example of a very common anxiety-dream, free from any suspicion of a sexual
meaning. In the analysis, the dreamer first thought of a story told him
by his uncle (chronologically later than the dream), viz., that he was
attacked at night in the street by a suspicious- looking individual; and
he concluded from this association that he might have heard of a similar
episode at the time of the dream. In association with the hatchet, he recalled
that during this period of his life he once hurt his hand with a hatchet
while chopping wood. This immediately reminded him of his relations with
his younger brother, whom he used to maltreat and knock down. He recalled,
in particular, one occasion when he hit his brother's head with his boot
and made it bleed, and his mother said: "I'm afraid he will kill him one
day." While he seemed to be thus held by the theme of violence, a memory
from his ninth year suddenly emerged. His parents had come home late and
had gone to bed, whilst he was pretending to be asleep. He soon heard panting,
and other sounds that seemed to him mysterious, and he could also guess
the position of his parents in bed. His further thoughts showed that he
had established an analogy between this relation between his parents and
his own relation to his younger brother. He subsumed what was happening
between his parents under the notion of "an act of violence and a fight."
The fact that he had frequently noticed blood in his mother's bed corroborated
this conception.

<P>&nbsp;That the sexual intercourse of adults appears strange and alarming
to children who observe it, and arouses anxiety in them, is, I may say,
a fact established by everyday experience. I have explained this anxiety
on the ground that we have here a sexual excitation which is not mastered
by the child's understanding, and which probably also encounters repulsion
because their parents are involved, and is therefore transformed into anxiety.
At a still earlier period of life the sexual impulse towards the parent
of opposite sex does not yet suffer repression, but as we have seen (chapter
V., D.) expresses itself freely.

<P>&nbsp;For the night terrors with hallucinations (pavor nocturnus) so
frequent in children I should without hesitation offer the same explanation.
These, too, can only be due to misunderstood and rejected sexual impulses
which, if recorded, would probably show a temporal periodicity, since an
intensification of sexual libido may equally be produced by accidentally
exciting impressions and by spontaneous periodic processes of development.

<P>&nbsp;I have not the necessary observational material for the full demonstration
of this explanation. * On the other hand, pediatrists seem to lack the
point of view which alone makes intelligible the whole series of phenomena,
both from the somatic and from the psychic side. To illustrate by a comical
example how closely, if one is made blind by the blinkers of medical mythology,
one may pass by the understanding of such cases, I will cite a case which
I found in a thesis on pavor nocturnus (Debacker, 1881, p. 66).

<P>* This material has since been provided in abundance by the literature
of psycho-analysis.

<P>A boy of thirteen, in delicate health, began to be anxious and dreamy;
his sleep became uneasy, and once almost every week it was interrupted
by an acute attack of anxiety with hallucinations. The memory of these
dreams was always very distinct. Thus he was able to relate that the devil
had shouted at him: "Now we have you, now we have you!" and then there
was a smell of pitch and brimstone, and the fire burned his skin. From
this dream he woke in terror; at first he could not cry out; then his voice
came back to him, and he was distinctly heard to say: "No, no, not me;
I haven't done anything," or: "Please, don't; I will never do it again!"
At other times he said: "Albert has never done that!" Later he avoided
undressing, "because the fire attacked him only when he was undressed."
In the midst of these evil dreams, which were endangering his health, he
was sent into the country, where he recovered in the course of eighteen
months. At the age of fifteen he confessed one day: "Je n'osais pas l'avouer,
mais j'eprouvais continuellement des picotements et des surexcitations
aux parties; * a la fin, cela m'enervait tant que plusieurs fois j'ai pense
me jeter par la fenetre du dortoir." *(2)

<P>* The emphasis [on 'parties'] is my own, though the meaning is plain
enough without it.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) I did not dare admit it, but I continually felt tinglings
and overexcitements of the parts; at the end, it wearied me so much that
several times I thought to throw myself from the dormitory window.

<P>It is, of course, not difficult to guess: 1. That the boy had practised
masturbation in former years, that he had probably denied it, and was threatened
with severe punishment for his bad habit (His confession: Je ne le ferai
plus; * his denial: Albert n'a jamais fait ca.) *(2) 2. That, under the
advancing pressure of puberty, the temptation to masturbate was re-awakened
through the titillation of the genitals. 3. That now, however, there arose
within him a struggle for repression, which suppressed the libido and transformed
it into anxiety, and that this anxiety now gathered up the punishments
with which he was originally threatened.

<P>* I will not do it again.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) Albert never did that.

<P>Let us, on the other hand, see what conclusions were drawn by the author
(p. 69):

<P>&nbsp;"1. It is clear from this observation that the influence of puberty
may produce in a boy of delicate health a condition of extreme weakness,
and that this may lead to a very marked cerebral anaemia. *

<P>* The italics ['very marked cerebral anaemia.'] are mine.

<P>"2. This cerebral anaemia produces an alteration of character, demono-maniacal
hallucinations, and very violent nocturnal, and perhaps also diurnal, states
of anxiety.

<P>&nbsp;"3. The demonomania and the self-reproaches of the boy can be
traced to the influences of a religious education which had acted upon
him as a child.

<P>&nbsp;"4. All manifestations disappeared as a result of a lengthy sojourn
in the country, bodily exercise, and the return of physical strength after
the termination of puberty.

<P>&nbsp;"5. Possibly an influence predisposing to the development of the
boy's cerebral state may be attributed to heredity and to the father's
former syphilis."

<P>&nbsp;Then finally come the concluding remarks: "Nous avons fait entrer
cette observation dans le cadre delires apyretiques d'inanition, car c'est
a l'ischemie cerebrale que nous rattachons cet etat particulier." *

<P>* We put this case in the file of apyretic delirias of inanition, for
it is to cerebral anaemia that we attach this particular state.
