F. Examples- Arithmetic and Speech in Dreams</H3>
Before I proceed to assign to its proper place the fourth of the factors
which control the formation of dreams, I shall cite a few examples from
my collection of dreams, partly for the purpose of illustrating the co-operation
of the three factors with which we are already acquainted, and partly for
the purpose of adducing evidence for certain unsupported assertions which
have been made, or of bringing out what necessarily follows from them.
It has, of course, been difficult in the foregoing account of the dream-work
to demonstrate my conclusions by means of examples. Examples in support
of isolated statements are convincing only when considered in the context
of an interpretation of a dream as a whole; when they are wrested from
their context, they lose their value; on the other hand, a dream-interpretation,
even when it is by no means profound, soon becomes so extensive that it
obscures the thread of the discussion which it is intended to illustrate.
This technical consideration must be my excuse if I now proceed to mix
together all sorts of things which have nothing in common except their
reference to the text of the foregoing chapter.

<P>&nbsp;We shall first consider a few examples of very peculiar or unusual
methods of representation in dreams. A lady dreamed as follows: A servant-girl
is standing on a ladder as though to clean the windows, and has with her
a chimpanzee and a gorilla cat (later corrected, angora cat). She throws
the animals on to the dreamer; the chimpanzee nestles up to her, and this
is very disgusting. This dream has accomplished its purpose by a very simple
means, namely, by taking a mere figure of speech literally, and representing
it in accordance with the literal meaning of its words. Monkey, like the
names of animals in general, is an opprobrious epithet, and the situation
of the dream means merely to hurl invectives. This same collection will
soon furnish us with further examples of the employment of this simple
artifice in the dream-work.

<P>&nbsp;Another dream proceeds in a very similar manner: A woman with
a child which has a conspicuously deformed cranium; the dreamer has heard
that the child acquired this deformity owing to its position in its mother's
womb. The doctor says that the cranium might be given a better shape by
means of compression, but that this would injure the brain. She thinks
that because it is a boy it won't suffer so much from deformity. This dream
contains a plastic representation of the abstract concept: Childish impressions,
with which the dreamer has become familiar in the course of the treatment.

<P>&nbsp;In the following example the dream-work follows rather a different
course. The dream contains a recollection of an excursion to the Hilmteich,
near Graz: There is a terrible storm outside; a miserable hotel- the water
is dripping from the walls, and the beds are damp. (The latter part of
the content was less directly expressed than I give it.) The dream signifies
superfluous. The abstract idea occurring in the dream-thoughts is first
made equivocal by a certain abuse of language; it has perhaps been replaced
by overflowing, or by fluid and super-fluid (-fluous), and has then been
brought to representation by an accumulation of like impressions. Water
within, water without, water in the beds in the form of dampness- everything
fluid and super fluid. That for the purposes of dream-representation the
spelling is much less considered than the sound of words ought not to surprise
us when we remember that rhyme exercises a similar privilege.

<P>&nbsp;The fact that language has at its disposal a great number of words
which were originally used in a pictorial and concrete sense, but are at
present used in a colourless and abstract fashion, has, in certain other
cases, made it very easy for the dream to represent its thoughts. The dream
has only to restore to these words their full significance, or to follow
their change of meaning a little way back. For example, a man dreams that
his friend, who is struggling to get out of a very tight place, calls upon
him for help. The analysis shows that the tight place is a hole, and that
the dreamer symbolically uses these very words to his friend: "Be careful,
or you'll get yourself into a hole." * Another dreamer climbs a mountain
from which he obtains an extraordinarily extensive view. He identifies
himself with his brother, who is editing a review dealing with the Far
East.

<P>* English Example.- TR.

<P>In a dream in Der Grune Heinrich, a spirited horse is plunging about
in a field of the finest oats, every grain of which is really "a sweet
almond, a raisin and a new penny" wrapped in red silk and tied with a bit
of pig's bristle." The poet (or the dreamer) immediately furnishes the
meaning of this dream, for the horse felt himself pleasantly tickled, so
that he exclaimed: "The oats are pricking me" ("I feel my oats").

<P>&nbsp;In the old Norse sagas (according to Henzen) prolific use is made
in dreams of colloquialisms and witty expressions; one scarcely finds a
dream without a double meaning or a play upon words.

<P>&nbsp;It would be a special undertaking to collect such methods of representation
and to arrange them in accordance with the principles upon which they are
based. Some of the representations are almost witty. They give one the
impression that one would have never guessed their meaning if the dreamer
himself had not succeeded in explaining it.

<P>&nbsp;1. A man dreams that he is asked for a name, which, however, he
cannot recall. He himself explains that this means: "I shouldn't dream
of it."

<P>&nbsp;2. A female patient relates a dream in which all the persons concerned
were singularly large. "That means," she adds, "that it must deal with
an episode of my early childhood, for at that time all grown-up people
naturally seemed to me immensely large." She herself did not appear in
the dream.

<P>&nbsp;The transposition into childhood is expressed differently in other
dreams- by the translation of time into space. One sees persons and scenes
as though at a great distance, at the end of a long road, or as though
one were looking at them through the wrong end of a pair of opera-glasses.

<P>&nbsp;3. A man who in waking life shows an inclination to employ abstract
and indefinite expressions, but who otherwise has his wits about him, dreams,
in a certain connection, that he reaches a railway station just as a train
is coming in. But then the platform moves towards the train, which stands
still; an absurd inversion of the real state of affairs. This detail, again,
is nothing more than an indication to the effect that something else in
the dream must be inverted. The analysis of the same dream leads to recollections
of picture-books in which men were represented standing on their heads
and walking on their hands.

<P>&nbsp;4. The same dreamer, on another occasion, relates a short dream
which almost recalls the technique of a rebus. His uncle gives him a kiss
in an automobile. He immediately adds the interpretation, which would never
have occurred to me: it means auto-erotism. In the waking state this might
have been said in jest.

<P>&nbsp;5. At a New Year's Eve dinner the host, the patriarch of the family,
ushered in the New Year with a speech. One of his sons-in- law, a lawyer,
was not inclined to take the old man seriously, especially when in the
course of his speech he expressed himself as follows: "When I open the
ledger for the Old Year and glance at its pages I see everything on the
asset side and nothing, thank the Lord, on the side of liability; all you
children have been a great asset, none of you a liability." On hearing
this the young lawyer thought of X, his wife's brother, who was a cheat
and a liar, and whom he had recently extricated from the entanglements
of the law. That night, in a dream. he saw the New Year's celebration once
more, and heard the speech, or rather saw it. Instead of speaking, the
old man actually opened the ledger, and on the side marked assets he saw
his name amongst others, but on the other side, marked liability, there
was the name of his brother-in-law, X. However, the word liability was
changed into Lie-Ability, which he regarded as X's main characteristic.
*

<P>* Reported by Brill in his Fundamental Conceptions of Psychoanalysis.

<P>6. A dreamer treats another person for a broken bone. The analysis shows
that the fracture represents a broken marriage vow, etc.

<P>&nbsp;7. In the dream-content the time of day often represents a certain
period of the dreamer's childhood. Thus, for example, 5:15 a.m. means to
one dreamer the age of five years and three months; when he was that age,
a younger brother was born.

<P>&nbsp;8. Another representation of age in a dream: A woman is walking
with two little girls; there is a difference of fifteen months in their
ages. The dreamer cannot think of any family of her acquaintance in which
this is the case. She herself interprets it to mean that the two children
represent her own person, and that the dream reminds her that the two traumatic
events of her childhood were separated by this period of time 3 1/2 and
4 3/4 years).

<P>&nbsp;9. It is not astonishing that persons who are undergoing psycho-
analytic treatment frequently dream of it, and are compelled to give expression
in their dreams to all the thoughts and expectations aroused by it. The
image chosen for the treatment is as a rule that of a journey, usually
in a motor-car, this being a modern and complicated vehicle; in the reference
to the speed of the car the patient's ironical humour is given free play.
If the unconscious, as an element of waking thought, is to be represented
in the dream, it is replaced, appropriately enough, by subterranean localities,
which at other times, when there is no reference to analytic treatment,
have represented the female body or the womb. Below in the dream very often
refers to the genitals, and its opposite, above, to the face, mouth or
breast. By wild beasts the dream-work usually symbolizes passionate impulses;
those of the dreamer, and also those of other persons of whom the dreamer
is afraid; or thus, by means of a very slight displacement, the persons
who experience these passions. From this it is not very far to the totemistic
representation of the dreaded father by means of vicious animals, dogs,
wild horses, etc. One might say that wild beasts serve to represent the
libido, feared by the ego, and combated by repression. Even the neurosis
itself, the sick person, is often separated from the dreamer and exhibited
in the dream as an independent person.

<P>&nbsp;One may go so far as to say that the dream-work makes use of all
the means accessible to it for the visual representation of the dream-thoughts,
whether these appear admissible or inadmissible to waking criticism, and
thus exposes itself to the doubt as well as the derision of all those who
have only hearsay knowledge of dream-interpretation, but have never themselves
practised it. Stekel's book, Die Sprache des Traumes, is especially rich
in such examples, but I avoid citing illustrations from this work as the
author's lack of critical judgment and his arbitrary technique would make
even the unprejudiced observer feel doubtful.

<P>&nbsp;10. From an essay by V. Tausk ("Kleider und Farben in Dienste
der Traumdarstellung," in Interna. Zeitschr. fur Ps. A., ii [1914]):

<P>&nbsp;(a) A dreams that he sees his former governess wearing a dress
of black lustre, which fits closely over her buttocks. That means he declares
this woman to be lustful.

<P>&nbsp;(b) C in a dream sees a girl on the road to X bathed in a white
light and wearing a white blouse.

<P>&nbsp;The dreamer began an affair with a Miss White on this road.

<P>&nbsp;11. In an analysis which I carried out in the French language
I had to interpret a dream in which I appeared as an elephant. I naturally
had to ask why I was thus represented: "Vous me trompez," answered the
dreamer (Trompe = trunk).

<P>&nbsp;The dream-work often succeeds in representing very refractory
material, such as proper names, by means of the forced exploitation of
very remote relations. In one of my dreams old Brucke has set me a task.
I make a preparation, and pick something out of it which looks like crumpled
tinfoil. (I shall return to this dream later.) The corresponding association,
which is not easy to find, is stanniol, and now I know that I have in mind
the name of the author Stannius, which appeared on the title- page of a
treatise on the nervous system of fishes, which in my youth I regarded
with reverence. The first scientific problem which my teacher set me did
actually relate to the nervous system of a fish- the Ammocoetes. Obviously,
this name could not be utilized in the picture-puzzle.

<P>&nbsp;Here I must not fail to include a dream with a curious content,
which is worth noting also as the dream of a child, and which is readily
explained by analysis: A lady tells me: "I can remember that when I was
a child I repeatedly dreamed that God wore a conical paper hat on His head.
They often used to make me wear such a hat at table, so that I shouldn't
be able to look at the plates of the other children and see how much they
had received of any particular dish. Since I had heard that God was omniscient,
the dream signified that I knew everything in spite of the hat which I
was made to wear."

<P>&nbsp;What the dream-work consists in, and its unceremonious handling
of its material, the dream-thoughts, may be shown in an instructive manner
by the numbers and calculations which occur in dreams. Superstition, by
the way, regards numbers as having a special significance in dreams. I
shall therefore give a few examples of this kind from my collection.

<P>&nbsp;1. From the dream of a lady, shortly before the end of her treatment:

<P>&nbsp;She wants to pay for something or other; her daughter takes 3
florins 65 kreuzer from her purse; but the mother says: "What are you doing?
It costs only 21 kreuzer." This fragment of the dream was intelligible
without further explanation owing to my knowledge of the dreamer's circumstances.
The lady was a foreigner, who had placed her daughter at school in Vienna,
and was able to continue my treatment as long as her daughter remained
in the city. In three weeks the daughter's scholastic year would end, and
the treatment would then stop. On the day before the dream the principal
of the school had asked her whether she could not decide to leave the child
at school for another year. She had then obviously reflected that in this
case she would be able to continue the treatment for another year. Now,
this is what the dream refers to, for a year is equal to 365 days; the
three weeks remaining before the end of the scholastic year, and of the
treatment, are equivalent to 21 days (though not to so many hours of treatment).
The numerals, which in the dream- thoughts refer to periods of time, are
given money values in the dream, and simultaneously a deeper meaning finds
expression- for time is money. 365 kreuzer, of course, are 3 florins 65
kreuzer. The smallness of the sums which appear in the dream is a self-
evident wish-fulfilment; the wish has reduced both the cost of the treatment
and the year's school fees.

<P>&nbsp;2. In another dream the numerals are involved in even more complex
relations. A young lady, who has been married for some years, learns that
an acquaintance of hers, of about the same age, Elise L, has just become
engaged. Thereupon she dreams: She is sitting in the theatre with her husband
and one side of the stalls is quite empty. Her husband tells her that Elise
L and her fiance had also wished to come to the theatre, but that they
only could have obtained poor seats; three for 1 florin 50 kreuzer, and
of course they could not take those. She thinks they didn't lose much,
either.

<P>&nbsp;What is the origin of the 1 florin 50 kreuzer? A really indifferent
incident of the previous day. The dreamer's sister-in- law had received
150 florins as a present from her husband, and hastened to get rid of them
by buying some jewellery. Let us note that 150 florins is 100 times 1 florin
50 kreuzer. But whence the 3 in connection with the seats in the theatre?
There is only one association for this, namely, that the fiance is three
months younger than herself. When we have ascertained the significance
of the fact that one side of the stalls is empty we have the solution of
the dream. This feature is an undisguised allusion to a little incident
which had given her husband a good excuse for teasing her. She had decided
to go to the theatre that week; she had been careful to obtain tickets
a few days beforehand, and had had to pay the advance booking-fee. When
they got to the theatre they found that one side of the house was almost
empty; so that she certainly need not have been in such a hurry.

<P>&nbsp;I shall now substitute the dream-thoughts for the dream: "It surely
was nonsense to marry so early; there was no need for my being in such
a hurry. From Elise L's example I see that I should have got a husband
just the same- and one a hundred times better- If I had only waited (antithesis
to the haste of her sister-in- law), I could have bought three such men
for the money (the dowry)!"- Our attention is drawn to the fact that the
numerals in this dream have changed their meanings and their relations
to a much greater extent than in the. one previously considered. The transforming
and distorting activity of the dream has in this case been greater- a fact
which we interpret as meaning that these dream-thoughts had to overcome
an unusual degree of endo- psychic resistance before they attained to representation.
And we must not overlook the fact that the dream contains an absurd element,
namely, that two persons are expected to take three seats. It will throw
some light on the question of the interpretation of absurdity in dreams
if I remark that this absurd detail of the dream-content is intended to
represent the most strongly emphasized of the dream-thoughts: "It was nonsense
to marry so early." The figure 3, which occurs in a quite subordinate relation
between the two persons compared (three months' difference in their ages),
has thus been adroitly utilized to produce the idea of nonsense required
by the dream. The reduction of the actual 150 florins to 1 florin 50 kreuzer
corresponds to the dreamer's disparagement of her husband in her suppressed
thoughts.

<P>&nbsp;3. Another example displays the arithmetical powers of dreams,
which have brought them into such disrepute. A man dreams: He is sitting
in the B's house (the B's are a family with which he was formerly acquainted),
and he says: "It was nonsense that you didn't give me Amy for my wife."
Thereupon, he asks the girl: "How old are you?" Answer: "I was born in
1882." "Ah, then you are 28 years old."

<P>&nbsp;Since the dream was dreamed in the year 1898, this is obviously
bad arithmetic, and the inability of the dreamer to calculate may, if it
cannot be otherwise explained, be likened to that of a general paralytic.
My patient was one of those men who cannot help thinking about every woman
they see. The patient who for some months came next after him in my consulting-room
was a young lady; he met this lady after he had constantly asked about
her, and he was very anxious to make a good impression on her. This was
the lady whose age he estimated at 28. So much for explaining the result
of his apparent calculation. But 1882 was the year in which he had married.
He had been unable to refrain from entering into conversation with the
two other women whom he met at my house- the two by no means youthful maids
who alternately opened the door to him- and as he did not find them very
responsive, he had told himself that they probably regarded him as elderly
and serious.

<P>&nbsp;Bearing in mind these examples, and others of a similar nature
(to follow), we may say: The dream-work does not calculate at all, whether
correctly or incorrectly; it only strings together, in the form of a sum,
numerals which occur in the dream-thoughts, and which may serve as allusions
to material which is insusceptible of representation. It thus deals with
figures, as material for expressing its intentions, just as it deals with
all other concepts, and with names and speeches which are only verbal images.

<P>&nbsp;For the dream-work cannot compose a new speech. No matter how
many speeches; and answers, which may in themselves be sensible or absurd,
may occur in dreams, analysis shows us that the dream has taken from the
dream-thoughts fragments of speeches which have really been delivered or
heard, and has dealt with them in the most arbitrary fashion. It has not
only torn them from their context and mutilated them, accepting one fragment
and rejecting another, but it has often fitted them together in a novel
manner, so that the speech which seems coherent in a dream is dissolved
by analysis into three or four components. In this new application of the
words the dream has often ignored the meaning which they had in the dream-thoughts,
and has drawn an entirely new meaning from them. * Upon closer inspection,
the more distinct and compact ingredients of the dream-speech may be distinguished
from others, which serve as connectives, and have probably been supplied,
just as we supply omitted letters and syllables in reading. The dream-speech
thus has the structure of breccia, in which the larger pieces of various
material are held together by a solidified cohesive medium.

<P>* Analyses of other numerical dreams have been given by Jung, Marcinowski
and others. Such dreams often involve very complicated arithmetical operations,
which are none the less solved by the dreamer with astonishing confidence.
Cf. also Ernest Jones, "Uber unbewusste Zahlenbehandlung," Zentralb. fur
Psychoanalyse, 4, ii, [1912], p. 241).

<P>&nbsp;Neurosis behaves in the same fashion. I know a patient who- involuntarily
and unwillingly- hears (hallucinates) songs or fragments of songs without
being able to understand their significance for her psychic life. She is
certainly not a paranoiac. Analysis shows that by exercising a certain
license she gave the text of these songs a false application. "Oh, thou
blissful one! Oh, thou happy one!" This is the first line of Christmas
carol, but by not continuing it to the word, Christmastide, she turns it
into a bridal song, etc. The same mechanism of distortion may operate,
without hallucination, merely in association.

<P>Strictly speaking, of course, this description is correct only for those
dream-speeches which have something of the sensory character of a speech,
and are described as speeches. The others, which have not, as it were,
been perceived as heard or spoken (which have no accompanying acoustic
or motor emphasis in the dream) are simply thoughts, such as occur in our
waking life, and find their way unchanged into many of our dreams. Our
reading, too, seems to provide an abundant and not easily traceable source
for the indifferent speech-material of dreams. But anything that is at
all conspicuous as a speech in a dream can be referred to actual speeches
which have been made or heard by the dreamer.

<P>&nbsp;We have already found examples of the derivation of such dream-
speeches in the analyses of dreams which have been cited for other purposes.
Thus, in the innocent market-dream (chapter V., A.) where the speech: That
is no longer to be had serves to identify me with the butcher, while a
fragment of the other speech: I don't know that, I don't take that, precisely
fulfils the task of rendering the dream innocent. On the previous day,
the dreamer, replying to some unreasonable demand on the part of her cook,
had waved her aside with the words: I don't know that, behave yourself
properly, and she afterwards took into the dream the first, indifferent-sounding
part of the speech in order to allude to the latter part, which fitted
well into the phantasy underlying the dream, but which might also have
betrayed it.

<P>&nbsp;Here is one of many examples which all lead to the same conclusion:

<P>&nbsp;A large courtyard in which dead bodies are being burned. The dreamer
says, "I'm going, I can't stand the sight of it." (Not a distinct speech.)
Then he meets two butcher boys and asks, "Well, did it taste good?" And
one of them answers, "No, it wasn't good." As though it had been human
flesh.

<P>&nbsp;The innocent occasion of this dream is as follows: After taking
supper with his wife, the dreamer pays a visit to his worthy but by no
means appetizing neighbour. The hospitable old lady is just sitting down
to her own supper, and presses him (among men a composite, sexually significant
word is used jocosely in the place of this word) to taste it. He declines,
saying that he has no appetite. She replies: "Go on with you, you can manage
it all right," or something of the kind. The dreamer is thus forced to
taste and praise what is offered him. "But that's good!" When he is alone
again with his wife, he complains of his neighbour's importunity, and of
the quality of the food which he has tasted. "I can't stand the sight of
it," a phrase that in the dream, too, does not emerge as an actual speech,
is a thought relating to the physical charms of the lady who invites him,
which may be translated by the statement that he has no desire to look
at her.

<P>&nbsp;The analysis of another dream- which I will cite at this stage
for the sake of a very distinct speech, which constitutes its nucleus,
but which will be explained only when we come to evaluate the affects in
dreams- is more instructive. I dream very vividly: I have gone to Brucke's
laboratory at night, and on hearing a gentle knocking at the door, I open
it to (the deceased) Professor Fleischl, who enters in the company of several
strangers, and after saying a few words sits down at his table. Then follows
a second dream: My friend Fl has come to Vienna, unobtrusively, in July;
I meet him in the street, in conversation with my (deceased) friend P,
and I go with them somewhere, and they sit down facing each other as though
at a small table, while I sit facing them at the narrow end of the table.
Fl speaks of his sister, and says: "In three-quarters of an hour she was
dead," and then something like "That is the threshold." As P does not understand
him, Fl turns to me, and asks me how much I have told P of his affairs.
At this, overcome by strange emotions, I try to tell Fl that P (cannot
possibly know anything, of course, because he) is not alive. But noticing
the mistake myself, I say: "Non vixit." Then I look searchingly at P, and
under my gaze he becomes pale and blurred, and his eyes turn a sickly blue-
and at last he dissolves. I rejoice greatly at this; I now understand that
Ernst Fleischl, too, is only an apparition, a revenant, and I find that
it is quite possible that such a person should exist only so long as one
wishes him to, and that he can be made to disappear by the wish of another
person.

<P>&nbsp;This very pretty dream unites so many of the enigmatical characteristics
of the dream-content- the criticism made in the dream itself, inasmuch
as I myself notice my mistake in saying Non vixit instead of Non vivit,
the unconstrained intercourse with deceased persons, whom the dream itself
declares to be dead, the absurdity of my conclusion, and the intense satisfaction
which it gives me- that "I would give my life" to expound the complete
solution of the problem. But in reality I am incapable of doing what I
do in the dream, i.e., of sacrificing such intimate friends to my ambition.
And if I attempted to disguise the facts, the true meaning of the dream,
with which I am perfectly familiar, would be spoiled. I must therefore
be content to select a few of the elements of the dream for interpretation,
some here, and some at a later stage.

<P>&nbsp;The scene in which I annihilate P with a glance forms the centre
of the dream. His eyes become strange and weirdly blue, and then he dissolves.
This scene is an unmistakable imitation of a scene that was actually experienced.
I was a demonstrator at the Physiological Institute; I was on duty in the
morning, and Brucke learned that on several occasions I had been unpunctual
in my attendance at the students' laboratory. One morning, therefore, he
arrived at the hour of opening, and waited for me. What he said to me was
brief and to the point; but it was not what he said that mattered. What
overwhelmed me was the terrible gaze of his blue eyes, before which I melted
away- as P does in the dream, for P has exchanged roles with me, much to
my relief. Anyone who remembers the eyes of the great master, which were
wonderfully beautiful even in his old age, and has ever seen him angered,
will readily imagine the emotions of the young transgressor on that occasion.

<P>&nbsp;But for a long while I was unable to account for the Non vixit
with which I pass sentence in the dream. Finally, I remembered that the
reason why these two words were so distinct in the dream was not because
they were heard or spoken, but because they were seen. Then I knew at once
where they came from. On the pedestal of the statue of the Emperor joseph
in the Vienna Hofburg are inscribed the following beautiful words:

<P>Saluti patriae vixit

<P>&nbsp;non diu sed totus. *

<P>* The inscription in fact reads:

<P>&nbsp;Saluti publicae vixit

<P>&nbsp;non diu sed totus.

<P>&nbsp;[He lived for the safety of the public, not for a long time, but
always.] The motive of the mistake: patriae [fatherland] for publicae,
has probably been correctly divined by Wittels.

<P>From this inscription I had taken what fitted one inimical train of
thought in my dream-thoughts, and which was intended to mean: "That fellow
has nothing to say in the matter, he is not really alive." And I now recalled
that the dream was dreamed a few days after the unveiling of the memorial
to Fleischl, in the cloisters of the University, upon which occasion I
had once more seen the memorial to Brucke, and must have thought with regret
(in the unconscious) how my gifted friend P, with all his devotion to science,
had by his premature death forfeited his just claim to a memorial in these
halls. So I set up this memorial to him in the dream; Josef is my friend
P's baptismal name. *

<P>* As an example of over-determination: My excuse for coming late was
that after working late into the night, in the morning I had to make the
long journey from Kaiser-Josef-Strasse to Wahringer Strasse.

<P>According to the rules of dream-interpretation, I should still not be
justified in replacing non vivit, which I need, by non vixit, which is
placed at my disposal by the recollection of the Kaiser Josef memorial.
Some other element of the dream-thoughts must have contributed to make
this possible. Something now calls my attention to the fact that in the
dream scene two trains of thought relating to my friend P meet, one hostile,
the other affectionate- the former on the surface, the latter covered up-
and both are given representation in the same words: non vixit. As my friend
P has deserved well of science, I erect a memorial to him; as he has been
guilty of a malicious wish (expressed at the end of the dream), I annihilate
him. I have here constructed a sentence with a special cadence, and in
doing so I must have been influenced by some existing model. But where
can I find a similar antithesis, a similar parallel between two opposite
reactions to the same person, both of which can claim to be wholly justified,
and which nevertheless do not attempt to affect one another? Only in one
passage which, however, makes a profound impression upon the reader- Brutus's
speech of justification in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: "As Caesar loved
me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant.
I honour him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him." Have we not here the
same verbal structure, and the same antithesis of thought, as in the dream-thoughts?
So I am playing Brutus in my dream. If only I could find in my dream-thoughts
another collateral connection to confirm this! I think it might be the
following: My friend Fl comes to Vienna in July. This detail is not the
case in reality. To my knowledge, my friend has never been in Vienna in
July. But the month of July is named after Julius Caesar, and might therefore
very well furnish the required allusion to the intermediate thought- that
I am playing the part of Brutus. * -

<P>* And also, Caesar = Kaiser.

<P>Strangely enough, I once did actually play the part of Brutus. When
I was a boy of fourteen, I presented the scene between Brutus and Caesar
in Schiller's poem to an audience of children: with the assistance of my
nephew, who was a year older than I, and who had come to us from England-
and was thus a revenant- for in him I recognized the playmate of my early
childhood. Until the end of my third year we had been inseparable; we had
loved each other and fought each other and, as I have already hinted, this
childish relation has determined all my later feelings in my intercourse
with persons of my own age. My nephew John has since then had many incarnations,
which have revivified first one and then another aspect of a character
that is ineradicably fixed in my unconscious memory. At times he must have
treated me very badly, and I must have opposed my tyrant courageously,
for in later years I was often told of a short speech in which I defended
myself when my father- his grandfather- called me to account: "Why did
you hit John?" "I hit him because he hit me." It must be this childish
scene which causes non vivit to become non vixit, for in the language of
later childhood striking is known as wichsen (German: wichsen = to polish,
to wax, i.e., to thrash); and the dream-work does not disdain to take advantage
of such associations. My hostility towards my friend P, which has so little
foundation in reality- he was greatly my superior, and might therefore
have been a new edition of my old playmate- may certainly be traced to
my complicated relations with John during our childhood. I shall, as I
have said, return to this dream later on.

G. Absurd Dreams- Intellectual Performances in Dreams</H3>

<H4>
I.</H4>
Hitherto, in our interpretation of dreams, we have come upon the element
of absurdity in the dream-content so frequently that we must no longer
postpone the investigation of its cause and its meaning. We remember, of
course, that the absurdity of dreams has furnished the opponents of dream-interpretation
with their chief argument for regarding the dream as merely the meaningless
product of an attenuated and fragmentary activity of the psyche.

<P>&nbsp;I will begin with a few examples in which the absurdity of the
dream-content is apparent only, disappearing when the dream is more thoroughly
examined. These are certain dreams which- accidently, one begins by thinking-
are concerned with the dreamer's dead father.

<P>&nbsp;1. Here is the dream of a patient who had lost his father six
years before the date of the dream:

<P>&nbsp;His father had been involved in a terrible accident. He was travelling
by the night express when the train was derailed, the seats were telescoped,
and his head was crushed from side to side. The dreamer sees him lying
on his bed; from his left eyebrow a wound runs vertically upwards. The
dreamer is surprised that his father should have met with an accident (since
he is dead already, as the dreamer adds in relating his dream). His father's
eyes are so clear.

<P>&nbsp;According to the prevailing standards of dream-criticism, this
dream-content would be explained as follows: At first, while the dreamer
is picturing his father's accident, he has forgotten that his father has
already been many years in his grave; in the course of the dream this memory
awakens, so that he is surprised at his own dream even while he is dreaming
it. Analysis, however, tells us that it is quite superfluous to seek for
such explanations. The dreamer had commissioned a sculptor to make a bust
of his father, and he had inspected the bust two days before the dream.
It is this which seems to him to have come to grief (the German word means
gone wrong or met with an accident). The sculptor has never seen his father,
and has had to work from photographs. On the very day before the dream
the son had sent an old family servant to the studio in order to see whether
he, too, would pass the some judgment upon the marble bust- namely, that
it was too narrow between the temples. And now follows the memory- material
which has contributed to the formation of the dream: The dreamer's father
had a habit, whenever he was harassed by business cares or domestic difficulties,
of pressing his temples between his hands, as though his head was growing
too large and be was trying to compress it. When the dreamer was four years
old, he was present when a pistol was accidentally discharged, and his
father's eyes were blackened (his eyes are so clear). When his father was
thoughtful or depressed, he had a deep furrow in his forehead just where
the dream shows his wound. The fact that in the dream this wrinkle is replaced
by a wound points to the second occasion for the dream. The dreamer had
taken a photograph of his little daughter; the plate had fallen from his
hand, and when he picked it up it revealed a crack which ran like a vertical
furrow across the child's forehead, extending as far as the eyebrow. He
could not help feeling a superstitious foreboding, for on the day before
his mother's death the negative of her portrait had been cracked.

<P>&nbsp;Thus, the absurdity of this dream is simply the result of a carelessness
of verbal expression, which does not distinguish between the bust or the
photograph and the original. We are all accustomed to making remarks like:
"Don't you think it's exactly your father?" The appearance of absurdity
in this dream might, of course, have been easily avoided. If it were permissible
to form an opinion on the strength of a single case, one might be tempted
to say that this semblance of absurdity is admitted or even desired.
<H4>
II.</H4>
Here is another example of the same kind from my own dreams (I lost my
father in the year 1896):

<P>&nbsp;After his death, my father has played a part in the political
life of the Magyars, and has united them into a political whole; and here
I see, indistinctly, a little picture: a number of men, as though in the
Reichstag; a man is standing on one or two chairs; there are others round
about him. I remember that on his deathbed he looked so like Garibaldi,
and I am glad that this promise has really come true.

<P>&nbsp;Certainly this is absurd enough. It was dreamed at the time when
the Hungarians were in a state of anarchy, owing to Parliamentary obstruction,
and were passing through the crisis from which Koloman Szell subsequently
delivered them. The trivial circumstance that the scenes beheld in dreams
consist of such little pictures is not without significance for the elucidation
of this element. The customary visual dream-representations of our thoughts
present images that impress us as being life-size; my dream-picture, however,
is the reproduction of a wood-cut inserted in the text of an illustrated
history of Austria, representing Maria Theresa in the Reichstag of Pressburg-
the famous scene of Moriamur pro rege nostro. * Like Maria Theresa, my
father, in my dream, is surrounded by the multitude; but he is standing
on one or two chairs (Stuhlen), and is thus, like a Stuhlrichter (presiding
judge). (He has united them; here the intermediary is the phrase: "We shall
need no judge.") Those of us who stood about my father's death-bed did
actually notice that he looked very like Garibaldi. He had a post-mortem
rise of temperature; his cheeks shone redder and redder... involuntarily
we continue: "And behind him, in unsubstantial (radiance), lay that which
subdues us all- the common fate."

<P>* [We die for our king.] I have forgotten in what author I found a reference
to a dream which was overrun with unusually small figures, the source of
which proved to be one of the engravings of Jacques Callot, which the dreamer
had examined during the day. These engravings contain an enormous number
of very small figures; a whole series of them deals with the horrors of
the Thirty Years War.

<P>This uplifting of our thoughts prepares us for the fact that we shall
have to deal with this common fate. The post-mortem rise in temperature
corresponds to the words after his death in the dream- content. The most
agonizing of his afflictions had been a complete paralysis of the intestines
(obstruction) during the last few weeks of his life. All sorts of disrespectful
thoughts associate themselves with this. One of my contemporaries, who
lost his father while still at the Gymnasium- upon which occasion I was
profoundly moved, and tendered him my friendship- once told me, derisively,
of the distress of a relative whose father had died in the street, and
had been brought home, when it appeared, upon undressing the corpse, that
at the moment of death, or post- mortem, an evacuation of the bowels (Stuhlentleerung)
had taken place. The daughter was deeply distressed by this circumstance,
because this ugly detail would inevitably spoil her memory of her father.
We have now penetrated to the wish that is embodied in this dream. To stand
after one's death before one's children great and undefiled: who would
not wish that? What now has become of the absurdity of this dream? The
appearance of absurdity was due only to the fact that a perfectly permissible
figure of speech, in which we are accustomed to ignore any absurdity that
may exist as between its components, has been faithfully represented in
the dream. Here again we can hardly deny that the appearance of absurdity
is desired and has been purposely produced.

<P>&nbsp;The frequency with which dead persons appear in our dreams as
living and active and associating with us has evoked undue astonishment,
and some curious explanations, which afford conspicuous proof of our misunderstanding
of dreams. And yet the explanation of these dreams is close at hand. How
often it happens that we say to ourselves: "If my father were still alive,
what would he say to this?" The dream can express this if in no other way
than by his presence in a definite situation. Thus, for instance, a young
man whose grandfather has left him a great inheritance dreams that the
old man is alive, and calls his grandson to account, reproaching him for
his lavish expenditure. What we regard as an objection to the dream on
account of our better knowledge that the man is already dead, is in reality
the consoling thought that the dead man does not need to learn the truth,
or satisfaction over the fact that he can no longer have a say in the matter.

<P>&nbsp;Another form of absurdity found in dreams of deceased relatives
does not express scorn and derision; it serves to express the extremest
repudiation, the representation of a suppressed thought which one would
like to believe the very last thing one would think of. Dreams of this
kind appear to be capable of solution only if we remember that a dream
makes no distinction between desire and reality. For example, a man who
nursed his father during his last illness, and who felt his death very
keenly, dreamed some time afterwards the following senseless dream: His
father was again living, and conversing with him as usual, but (and this
was the remarkable thing) he had nevertheless died, though he did not know
it. This dream is intelligible if, after he had nevertheless died, we insert
in consequence of the dreamer's wish, and if after but he did not know
it, we add that the dreamer had entertained this wish. While nursing him,
the son had often wished that his father was dead; that is, he had had
the really compassionate thought that it would be a good thing if death
would at last put an end to his sufferings. While he was mourning his father's
death, even this compassionate wish became an unconscious reproach, as
though it had really contributed to shorten the sick man's life. By the
awakening of the earliest infantile feelings against his father, it became
possible to express this reproach as a dream; and it was precisely because
of the extreme antithesis between the dream-instigator and the day- thoughts
that this dream had to assume so absurd a form. *

<P>* Cf. "Formulations regarding the Two Principles in Mental Functioning,"
Collected Papers, IV.

<P>As a general thing, the dreams of a deceased person of whom the dreamer
has been fond confront the interpreter with difficult problems, the solution
of which is not always satisfying. The reason for this may be sought in
the especially pronounced ambivalence of feeling which controls the relation
of the dreamer to the dead person. In such dreams it is quite usual for
the deceased person to be treated at first as living; then it suddenly
appears that he is dead; and in the continuation of the dream he is once
more living. This has a confusing effect. I at last divined that this alternation
of death and life is intended to represent the indifference of the dreamer
("It is all one to me whether he is alive or dead"). This indifference,
of course, is not real, but wished; its purpose is to help the dreamer
to deny his very intense and often contradictory emotional attitudes, and
so it becomes the dream-representation of his ambivalence. For other dreams
in which one meets with deceased persons the following rule will often
be a guide: If in the dream the dreamer is not reminded that the dead person
is dead, he sets himself on a par with the dead; he dreams of his own death.
The sudden realization or astonishment in the dream ("but he has long been
dead!") is a protest against this identification, and rejects the meaning
that the dreamer is dead. But I will admit that I feel that dream-interpretation
is far from having elicited all the secrets of dreams having this content.
<H4>
III.</H4>
In the example which I shall now cite, I can detect the dream- work in
the act of purposely manufacturing an absurdity for which there is no occasion
whatever in the dream-material. It is taken from the dream which I had
as a result of meeting Count Thun just before going away on a holiday.
I am driving in a cab, and I tell the driver to drive to a railway station.
"Of course, I can't drive with you on the railway track itself," I say,
after the driver had reproached me, as though I had worn him out; at the
same time, it seems as though I had already made with him a journey that
one usually makes by train. Of this confused and senseless story analysis
gives the following explanation: During the day I had hired a cab to take
me to a remote street in Dornbach. The driver, however, did not know the
way, and simply kept on driving, in the manner of such worthy people, until
I became aware of the fact and showed him the way, indulging in a few derisive
remarks. From this driver a train of thought led to the aristocratic personage
whom I was to meet later on. For the present, I will only remark that one
thing that strikes us middle- class plebeians about the aristocracy is
that they like to put themselves in the driver's seat. Does not Count Thun
guide the Austrian car of State? The next sentence in the dream, however,
refers to my brother, whom I thus also identify with the cab- driver. I
had refused to go to Italy with him this year (Of course, I can't drive
with you on the railway track itself), and this refusal was a sort of punishment
for his accustomed complaint that I usually wear him out on this tour (this
finds its way into the dream unchanged) by rushing him too quickly from
place to place, and making him see too many beautiful things in a single
day. That evening my brother had accompanied me to the railway station,
but shortly before the carriage had reached the Western station of the
Metropolitan Railway he had jumped out in order to take the train to Purkersdorf.
I suggested to him that he might remain with me a little longer, as he
did not travel to Purkersdorf by the Metropolitan but by the Western Railway.
This is why, in my dream, I made in the cab a journey which one usually
makes by train. In reality, however, it was the other way about: what I
told my brother was: "The distance which you travel on the Metropolitan
Railway you could travel in my company on the Western Railway" The whole
confusion of the dream is therefore due to the fact that in my dream I
replace "Metropolitan Railway" by cab, which, to be sure, does good service
in bringing the driver and my brother into conjunction. I then elicit from
the dream some nonsense which is hardly disentangled by elucidation, and
which almost constitutes a contradiction of my earlier speech (of course,
I cannot drive with you on the railway track itself). But as I have no
excuse whatever for confronting the Metropolitan Railway with the cab,
I must intentionally have given the whole enigmatical story this peculiar
form in my dream.

<P>&nbsp;But with what intention? We shall now learn what the absurdity
in the dream signifies, and the motives which admitted it or created it.
In this case the solution of the mystery is as follows: In the dream I
need an absurdity, and something incomprehensible, in connection with driving
(Fahren = riding, driving) because in the dream-thoughts I have a certain
opinion that demands representation. One evening, at the house of the witty
and hospitable lady who appears, in another scene of the same dream, as
the housekeeper, I heard two riddles which I could not solve: As they were
known to the other members of the party, I presented a somewhat ludicrous
figure in my unsuccessful attempts to find the solutions. They were two
puns turning on the words Nachkommen (to obey orders- offspring) and Vorfahren
(to drive- forefathers, ancestry). They ran, I believe, as follows:

<P>The coachman does it

<P>&nbsp;At the master's behests;

<P>&nbsp;Everyone has it;

<P>&nbsp;In the grave it rests.

<P>&nbsp;(Vorfahren)

<P>A confusing detail was that the first halves of the two riddles were
identical:

<P>The coachman does it

<P>&nbsp;At the master's behests;

<P>&nbsp;Not everyone has it,

<P>&nbsp;In the cradle it rests.

<P>&nbsp;(Nachkommen)

<P>When I saw Count Thun drive up (vorfahren) in state, and fell into the
Figaro-like mood, in which one finds that the sole merit of such aristocratic
gentlemen is that they have taken the trouble to be born (to become Nachkommen),
these two riddles became intermediary thoughts for the dream-work. As aristocrats
may readily be replaced by coachmen, and since it was once the custom to
call a coachman Herr Schwager (brother-in-law), the work of condensation
could involve my brother in the same representation. But the dream-thought
at work in the background is as follows: It is nonsense to be proud of
one's ancestors (Vorfahren). I would rather be an ancestor (Vorfahr) myself.
On account of this opinion, it is nonsense, we have the nonsense in the
dream. And now the last riddle in this obscure passage of the dream is
solved- namely that I have driven before (vorher gefahren, vorgefaltren)
with this driver.

<P>&nbsp;Thus, a dream is made absurd if there occurs in the dream- thoughts,
as one of the elements of the contents, the opinion: "That is nonsense";
and, in general, if criticism and derision are the motives of one of the
dreamer's unconscious trains of thought. Hence, absurdity is one of the
means by which the dream- work represents contradiction; another means
is the inversion of material relation between the dream-thoughts and the
dream- content; another is the employment of the feeling of motor inhibition.
But the absurdity of a dream is not to be translated by a simple no; it
is intended to reproduce the tendency of the dream-thoughts to express
laughter or derision simultaneously with the contradiction. Only with this
intention does the dream- work produce anything ridiculous. Here again
it transforms a part of the latent content into a manifest form. *

<P>* Here the dream-work parodies the thought which it qualifies as ridiculous,
in that it creates something ridiculous in relation to it. Heine does the
same thing when he wishes to deride the bad rhymes of the King of Bavaria.
He does it by using even worse rhymes:

<P>&nbsp;Herr Ludwig ist ein grosser Poet

<P>&nbsp;Und singt er, so sturzt Apollo

<P>&nbsp;Vor ihm auf die Knie und bittet und fleht,

<P>&nbsp;Halt ein, ich werde sonst toll, oh!

<P>As a matter of fact, we have already cited a convincing example of this
significance of an absurd dream. The dream (interpreted without analysis)
of the Wagnerian performance which lasted until 7.45 a.m., and in which
the orchestra is conducted from a tower, etc. (see this chapter, D.), is
obviously saving: It is a crazy world and an insane society. He who deserves
a thing doesn't get it, and he who doesn't care for it does get it. In
this way the dreamer compares her fate with that of her cousin. The fact
that dreams of a dead father were the first to furnish us with examples
of absurdity in dreams is by no means accidental. The conditions for the
creation of absurd dreams are here grouped together in a typical fashion.
The authority proper to the father has at an early age evoked the criticism
of the child, and the strict demands which he has made have caused the
child, in self- defence, to pay particularly close attention to every weakness
of his father's; but the piety with which the father's personality is surrounded
in our thoughts, especially after his death, intensifies the censorship
which prevents the expression of this criticism from becoming conscious.
<H4>
IV.</H4>
Here is another absurd dream of a deceased father:

<P>&nbsp;I receive a communication from the town council of my native city
concerning the cost of accommodation in the hospital in the year 1851.
This was necessitated by a seizure from which I was suffering. I make fun
of the matter for, in the first place, I was not yet born in 1851, and
in the second place, my father, to whom the communication might refer,
is already dead. I go to him in the adjoining room, where he is lying in
bed, and tell him about it. To my surprise he remembers that in the year
1851 he was once drink and had to be locked up or confined. It was when
he was working for the firm of T. "Then you, too, used to drink?" I ask.
"You married soon after?" I reckon that I was born in 1856, which seems
to me to be immediately afterwards.

<P>&nbsp;In the light of the foregoing exposition, we shall translate the
insistence with which this dream exhibits its absurdities as a sure sign
of a particularly embittered and passionate polemic in the dream-thoughts.
All the greater, then, is our astonishment when we perceive that in this
dream the polemic is waged openly, and that my father is denoted as the
person who is made a laughing-stock. Such frankness seems to contradict
our assumption of a censorship controlling the dream-work. The explanation
is that here the father is only an interposed figure, while the quarrel
is really with another person, who appears in the dream only in a single
allusion. Whereas a dream usually treats of revolt against other persons,
behind whom the father is concealed, here it is the other way about: the
father serves as the man of straw to represent another, and hence the dream
dares to concern itself openly with a person who is usually hallowed, because
there is present the certain knowledge that he is not in reality intended.
We learn of this condition of affairs by considering the occasion of the
dream. It was dreamed after I had heard that an older colleague, whose
judgment was considered infallible, had expressed disapproval and astonishment
on hearing that one of my patients had already been undergoing psychoanalytic
treatment at my hands for five years. The introductory sentences of the
dream allude in a transparently disguised manner to the fact that this
colleague had for a time taken over the duties which my father could no
longer perform (statement of expenses, accommodation in the hospital);
and when our friendly relations began to alter for the worse I was thrown
into the same emotional conflict as that which arises in the case of a
misunderstanding between father and son (by reason of the part played by
the father, and his earlier functions). The dream- thoughts now bitterly
resent the reproach that I am not making better progress, which extends
itself from the treatment of this patient to other things. Does my colleague
know anyone who can get on any faster? Does he not know that conditions
of this sort are usually incurable and last for life? What are four or
five years in comparison to a whole lifetime, especially when life has
been made so much easier for the patient during the treatment?

<P>&nbsp;The impression of absurdity in this dream is brought about largely
by the fact that sentences from different divisions of the dream-thoughts
are strung together without any reconciling transition. Thus, the sentence,
I go to him it the adjoining room, etc., leaves the subject from which
the preceding sentences are taken, and faithfully reproduces the circumstances
under which I told my father that I was engaged to be married. Thus the
dream is trying to remind me of the noble disinterestedness which the old
man showed at that time, and to contrast this with the conduct of another
newly-introduced person. I now perceive that the dream is allowed to make
fun of my father because in the dream-thoughts, in the full recognition
of his merits, he is held up as an example to others. It is in the nature
of every censorship that one is permitted to tell untruths about forbidden
things rather than the truth. The next sentence, to the effect that my
father remembers that he was once drink, and was locked up in consequence,
contains nothing that really relates to my father any more. The person
who is screened by him is here a no less important personage than the great
Meynert, in whose footsteps I followed with such veneration, and whose
attitude towards me, after a short period of favouritism, changed into
one of undisguised hostility. The dream recalls to me his own statement
that in his youth he had at one time formed the habit of intoxicating himself
with chloroform, with the result that he had to enter a sanatorium; and
also my second experience with him, shortly before his death. I had an
embittered literary controversy with him in reference to masculine hysteria,
the existence of which he denied, and when I visited him during his last
illness, and asked him how he felt, he described his condition at some
length, and concluded with the words: "You know, I have always been one
of the prettiest cases of masculine hysteria." Thus, to my satisfaction,
and to my astonishment, he admitted what he so long and so stubbornly denied.
But the fact that in this scene of my dream I can use my father to screen
Meynert is explained not by any discovered analogy between the two persons,
but by the fact that it is the brief yet perfectly adequate representation
of a conditional sentence in the dream- thoughts which, if fully expanded,
would read as follows: "Of course, if I belonged to the second generation,
if I were the son of a professor or a privy councillor, I should have progressed
more rapidly." In my dream I make my father a professor and a privy councillor.
The most obvious and most annoying absurdity of the dream lies in the treatment
of the date 1851, which seems to me to be indistinguishable from 1856,
as though a difference of five years meant nothing whatever. But it is
just this one of the dream-thoughts that requires expression. Four or five
years- that is precisely the length of time during which I enjoyed the
support of the colleague mentioned at the outset; but it is also the duration
of time I kept my fiance waiting before I married her; and by a coincidence
that is eagerly exploited by the dream- thoughts, it is also the time I
have kept my oldest patient waiting for a complete cure. "What are five
years?" ask the dream- thoughts. "That is no time at all to me, that isn't
worth consideration. I have time enough ahead of me, and just as what you
wouldn't believe came true at last, so I shall accomplish this also." Moreover,
the number 51, when considered apart from the number of the century, is
determined in yet another manner and in an opposite sense; for which reason
it occurs several times over in the dream. It is the age at which man seems
particularly exposed to danger; the age at which I have seen colleagues
die suddenly, among them one who had been appointed a few days earlier
to a professorship for which he had long been waiting.
<H4>
V.</H4>
Another absurd dream which plays with figures:

<P>&nbsp;An acquaintance of mine, Herr M, has been attacked in an essay
by no less a person than Goethe and, as we all think, with unjustifiable
vehemence. Herr M is, of course, crushed by this attack. He complains of
it bitterly at a dinner-party; but his veneration for Goethe has not suffered
as a result of this personal experience. I try to elucidate the temporal
relations a little, as they seem improbable to me. Goethe died in 1832;
since his attack upon M must, of course, have taken place earlier, M was
at the time quite a young man. It seems plausible to me that he was 18
years old. But I do not know exactly what the date of the present year
is, and so the whole calculation lapses into obscurity. The attack, by
the way, is contained in Goethe's well- known essay on "Nature."

<P>&nbsp;We shall soon find the means of justifying the nonsense of this
dream. Herr M, with whom I became acquainted at a dinner-party, had recently
asked me to examine his brother, who showed signs of general paralysis.
The conjecture was right; the painful thing about this visit was that the
patient gave his brother away by alluding to his youthful pranks, though
our conversation gave him no occasion to do so. I had asked the patient
to tell me the year of his birth, and had repeatedly got him to make trifling
calculations in order to show the weakness of his memory- which tests,
by the way, he passed quite well. Now I can see that I behave like a paralytic
in the dream (I do not know exactly what the date of the present year is).
Other material of the dream is drawn from another recent source. The editor
of a medical periodical, a friend of mine, had accepted for his paper a
very unfavourable crushing review of the last book of my Berlin friend,
Fl, the critic being a very youthful reviewer, who was not very competent
to pass judgment. I thought I had a right to interfere, and called the
editor to account; he greatly regretted his acceptance of the review, but
he would not promise any redress. I thereupon broke off my relations with
the periodical, and in my letter of resignation I expressed the hope that
our personal relations would not suffer as a result of the incident. The
third source of this dream is an account given by a female patient- it
was fresh in my memory at the time- of the psychosis of her brother who
had fallen into a frenzy crying "Nature, Nature." The physicians in attendance
thought that the cry was derived from a reading of Goethe's beautiful essay,
and that it pointed to the patient's overwork in the study of natural philosophy.
I thought, rather, of the sexual meaning in which even our less cultured
people use the word Nature, and the fact that the unfortunate man afterwards
mutilated his genitals seems to show that I was not far wrong. Eighteen
years was the age of this patient at the time of this access of frenzy.

<P>&nbsp;If I add, further, that the book of my so severely criticized
friend ("One asks oneself whether the author or oneself is crazy" had been
the opinion of another critic) treats of the temporal conditions of life,
and refers the duration of Goethe's life to the multiple of a number significant
from the biological point of view, it will readily be admitted that in
my dream I am putting myself in my friend's place. (I try to elucidate
the temporal relations a little.) But I behave like a paretic, and the
dream revels in absurdity. This means that the dream-thoughts say, ironically:
"Naturally, he is the fool, the lunatic, and you are the clever people
who know better. Perhaps, however, it is the other way about?" Now, the
other way about is abundantly represented in my dream, inasmuch as Goethe
has attacked the young man, which is absurd, while it is perfectly possible
even today for a young fellow to attack the immortal Goethe; and inasmuch
as I reckon from the year of Goethe's death, while I made the paretic reckon
from the year of his birth.

<P>&nbsp;But I have further promised to show that no dream is inspired
by other than egoistical motives. Accordingly, I must account for the fact
that in this dream I make my friend's cause my own, and put myself in his
place. My critical conviction in waking life would not justify my doing
so. Now, the story of the eighteen- year-old patient, and the divergent
interpretations of his cry, "Nature," allude to the fact that I have put
myself into opposition to the majority of physicians by claiming a sexual
aetiology for the psychoneuroses. I may say to myself: "You will meet with
the same kind of criticism as your friend; indeed you have already done
so to some extent"; so that I may now replace the he in the dream-thoughts
by we. "Yes, you are right; we two are the fools." That mea res agitur
is clearly shown by the mention of the short, incomparably beautiful essay
of Goethe's, for it was a popular lecture on this essay which induced me
to study the natural sciences when I left the Gymnasium, and was still
undecided as to my future.
<H4>
VI.</H4>
I have to show that yet another dream in which my ego does not appear is
none the less egoistic. In chapter V., D., I referred to a short dream
in which Professor M says: "My son, the myopic..."; and I stated that this
was only a preliminary dream, preceding another in which I play a part.
Here is the main dream, previously omitted, which challenges us to explain
its absurd and unintelligible word-formation.

<P>&nbsp;On account of something or other that is happening in Rome, it
is necessary for the children to flee, and this they do. The scene is then
laid before a gate, a double gate in the ancient style (the Porta Romana
in Siena, as I realize while I am dreaming). I am sitting on the edge of
a well, and I am greatly depressed; I am almost weeping. A woman- a nurse,
a nun- brings out the two boys and hands them over to their father, who
is not myself. The elder is distinctly my eldest son, but I do not see
the face of the other boy. The woman asks the eldest boy for a parting
kiss. She is remarkable for a red nose. The boy refuses her the kiss, but
says to her, extending her his hand in parting, "Auf Geseres," and to both
of us (or to one of us) "Auf Ungeseres." I have the idea that this indicates
a preference.

<P>&nbsp;This dream is built upon a tangle of thoughts induced by a play
I saw at the theatre, called Das neue Ghetto (The New Ghetto). The Jewish
question, anxiety as to the future of my children, who cannot be given
a fatherland, anxiety as to educating them so that they may enjoy the privileges
of citizens- all these features may easily be recognized in the accompanying
dream- thoughts.

<P>&nbsp;"By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept." Siena, like Rome,
is famous for its beautiful fountains. In the dream I have to find some
sort of substitute for Rome (cf. chapter V., B.) from among localities
which are known to me. Near the Porta Romana of Siena we saw a large, brightly-lit
building, which we learned was the Manicomio, the insane asylum. Shortly
before the dream I had heard that a co-religionist had been forced to resign
a position, which he had secured with great effort, in a State asylum.

<P>&nbsp;Our interest is aroused by the speech: "Auf Geseres," where one
might expect, from the situation continued throughout the dream, "Auf Wiedersehen"
(Au revoir), and by its quite meaningless antithesis: "Auf Ungeseres."
(Un is a prefix meaning "not.")

<P>&nbsp;According to information received from Hebrew scholars, Geseres
is a genuine Hebrew word, derived from the verb goiser, and may best be
rendered by "ordained sufferings, fated disaster." From its employment
in the Jewish jargon one would take it to mean "wailing and lamentation."
Ungeseres is a coinage of my own, and is the first to attract my attention,
but for the present it baffles me. The little observation at the end of
the dream- that Ungeseres indicates an advantage over Geseres- opens the
way to the associations, and therewith to understanding. This relation
holds good in the case of caviar; the unsalted kind is more highly prized
than the salted. "Caviar to the general"- "noble passions." Herein lies
concealed a jesting allusion to a member of my household, of whom I hope-
for she is younger than I- that she will watch over the future of my children;
this, too, agrees with the fact that another member of my household, our
worthy nurse, is clearly indicated by the nurse (or nun) of the dream.
But a connecting-link is wanting between the pair, salted- unsalted and
Geseres- Ungeseres. This is to be found in gesauert and ungesauert (leavened
and unleavened). In their flight or exodus from Egypt the children of Israel
had not time to allow their dough to become leavened, and in commemoration
of this event they eat unleavened bread at Passover to this day. Here,
too, I can find room for the sudden association which occurred to me in
this part of the analysis. I remembered how we, my friend from Berlin and
myself, had strolled about the streets of Breslau, a city which was strange
to us, during the last days of Easter. A little girl asked me the way to
a certain street; I had to tell her that I did not know it; I then remarked
to my friend, "I hope that later on in life the child will show more perspicacity
in selecting the persons whom she allows to direct her." Shortly afterwards
a sign caught my eye: "Dr. Herod, consulting hours..." I said to myself:
"I hope this colleague does not happen to be a children's specialist."
Meanwhile, my friend had been developing his views on the biological significance
of bilateral symmetry, and had begun a sentence with the words: "If we
had only one eye in the middle of the forehead, like Cyclops..." This leads
us to the speech of the professor in the preliminary dream: "My son, the
myopic." And now I have been led to the chief source for Geseres. Many
years ago, when this son of Professor M's, who is today an independent
thinker, was still sitting on his school-bench, he contracted an affection
of the eye which, according to the doctor, gave some cause for anxiety.
He expressed the opinion that so long as it was confined to one eye it
was of no great significance, but that if it should extend to the other
eye it would be serious. The affection subsided in the one eye without
leaving any ill effects; shortly afterwards, however, the same symptoms
did actually appear in the other eye. The boy's terrified mother immediately
summoned the physician to her distant home in the country. But the doctor
was now of a different opinion (took the other side). "What sort of 'Geseres'
is this you are making?" he asked the mother, impatiently. "If one side
got well, the other will, too." And so it turned out.

<P>&nbsp;And now as to the connection between this and myself and my family.
The school-bench upon which Professor M's son learned his first lessons
has become the property of my eldest son; it was given to him by the boy's
mother, and it is into his mouth that I put the words of farewell in the
dream. One of the wishes that may be connected with this transference may
now be readily guessed. This school-bench is intended by its construction
to guard the child from becoming shortsighted and one-sided. Hence myopia
(and behind it the Cyclops), and the discussion about bilateralism. The
fear of one-sidedness has a twofold significance; it might mean not only
physical one-sidedness, but intellectual one-sidedness also. Does it not
seem as though the scene in the dream, with all its craziness, were contradicting
precisely this anxiety? When on the one hand the boy has spoken his words
of farewell, on the other hand he calls out the very opposite, as though
to establish an equilibrium. He is acting, as it were, in obedience to
bilateral symmetry!

<P>&nbsp;Thus, a dream frequently has the profoundest meaning in the places
where it seems most absurd. In all ages those who have had something to
say and have been unable to say it without danger to themselves have gladly
donned the cap and bells. He for whom the forbidden saying was intended
was more likely to tolerate it if he was able to laugh at it, and to flatter
himself with the comment that what he disliked was obviously absurd. Dreams
behave in real life as does the prince in the play who is obliged to pretend
to be a madman, and hence we may say of dreams what Hamlet said of himself,
substituting an unintelligible jest for the actual truth: "I am but mad
north-northwest; when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw"
(Act II. sc. ii). *

<P>* This dream furnishes a good example in support of the universally
valid doctrine that dreams of the same night, even though they are separated
in the memory, spring from the same thought-material. The dream-situation
in which I am rescuing my children from the city of Rome, moreover, is
distorted by a reference back to an episode of my childhood. The meaning
is that I envy certain relatives who years ago had occasion to transplant
their children to the soil of another country.

<P>Thus, my solution of the problem of absurdity in dreams is that the
dream-thoughts are never absurd- at least, not those of the dreams of sane
persons- and that the dream-work produces absurd dreams, and dreams with
individually absurd elements, when the dream-thoughts contain criticism,
ridicule, and derision, which have to be given expression. My next concern
is to show that the dream-work is exhausted by the co-operation of the
three factors enumerated- and of a fourth which has still to be mentioned-
that it does no more than translate the dream-thoughts, observing the four
conditions prescribed, and that the question whether the mind goes to work
in dreams with all its intellectual faculties, or with only part of them,
is wrongly stated, and does not meet the actual state of affairs. But since
there are plenty of dreams in which judgments are passed, criticisms made,
and facts recognized in which astonishment at some individual element of
the dream appears, and explanations are attempted, and arguments adduced,
I must meet the objections deriving from these occurrences by the citation
of selected examples.

<P>&nbsp;My answer is as follows: Everything in dreams which occurs as
the apparent functioning of the critical faculty is to be regarded, not
as the intellectual performance of the dream-work, but as belonging to
the substance of the dream-thoughts, and it has found its way from these,
as a completed structure, into the manifest dream-content. I may go even
farther than this! I may even say that the judgments which are passed upon
the dream as it is remembered after waking, and the feelings which are
aroused by the reproduction of the dream, belong largely to the latent
dream- content, and must be fitted into place in the interpretation of
the dream.

<P>&nbsp;1. One striking example of this has already been given. A female
patient does not wish to relate her dream because it was too vague. She
saw a person in the dream, and does not know whether it was her husband
or her father. Then follows a second dream- fragment, in which there occurs
a manure-pail, with which the following reminiscence is associated. As
a young housewife she once declared jestingly, in the presence of a young
male relative who frequented the house, that her next business would be
to procure a new manure-pail. Next morning one was sent to her, but it
was filled with lilies of the valley. This part of the dream served to
represent the phrase, "Not grown on my own manure." * If we complete the
analysis, we find in the dream-thoughts the after-effect of a story heard
in youth; namely, that a girl had given birth to a child, and that it was
not clear who was the father. The dream-representation here overlaps into
the waking thought, and allows one of the elements of the dream-thoughts
to be represented by a judgment, formed in the waking state, of the whole
dream.

<P>* This German expression is equivalent to our saying: "I am not responsible
for that," "That's not my funeral," or "That's not due to my own efforts."-
TR.

<P>2. A similar case: One of my patients has a dream which strikes him
as being an interesting one, for he says to himself, immediately after
waking: "I must tell that to the doctor." The dream is analysed, and shows
the most distinct allusion to an affair in which he had become involved
during the treatment, and of which he had decided to tell me nothing. *

<P>* The injunction or resolve already contained in the dream: "I must
tell that to the doctor," when it occurs in dreams during psycho-analytic
treatment, is constantly accompanied by a great resistance to confessing
the dream, and is not infrequently followed by the forgetting of the dream.

<P>3. Here is a third example from my own experience:

<P>&nbsp;I go to the hospital with P, through a neighbourhood in which
there are houses and gardens. Thereupon I have an idea that I have already
seen this locality several times in my dreams. I do not know my way very
well; P shows me a way which leads round a corner to a restaurant (indoor);
here I ask for Frau Doni, and I hear that she is living at the back of
the house, in a small room, with three children. I go there, and on the
way I meet an undefined person with my two little girls. After I have been
with them for a while, I take them with me. A sort of reproach against
my wife for having left them there.

<P>&nbsp;On waking I am conscious of a great satisfaction, whose motive
seems to be the fact that I shall now learn from the analysis what is meant
by I have already dreamed of this. * But the analysis of the dream tells
me nothing about this; it shows me only that the satisfaction belongs to
the latent dream-content, and not to a judgment of the dream. It is satisfaction
concerning the fact that I have had children by my marriage. P's path through
life and my own ran parallel for a time; now he has outstripped me both
socially and financially, but his marriage has remained childless. Of this
the two occasions of the dream give proof on complete analysis. On the
previous day I had read in the newspaper the obituary notice of a certain
Frau Dona A- y (which I turn into Doni), who had died in childbirth; I
was told by my wife that the dead woman had been nursed by the same midwife
whom she herself had employed at the birth of our two youngest boys. The
name Dona had caught my attention, for I had recently met with it for the
first time in an English novel. The other occasion for the dream may be
found in the date on which it was dreamed; this was the night before the
birthday of my eldest boy, who, it seems, is poetically gifted.

<P>* A subject which has been extensively discussed in recent volumes If
the Revue Philosophique (paramnesia in dreams).

<P>4. The same satisfaction remained with me after waking from the absurd
dream that my father, after his death, had played a political role among
the Magyars. It is motivated by the persistence of the feeling which accompanied
the last sentence of the dream: I remember that on his deathbed he looked
so like Garibaldi, and I am glad that it has really come true... (Followed
by a forgotten continuation.) I can now supply from the analysis what should
fill this gap. It is the mention of my second boy, to whom I have given
the baptismal name of an eminent historical personage who attracted me
greatly during my boyhood, especially during my stay in England. I had
to wait for a year before I could fulfil my intention of using this name
if the next child should be a son, and with great satisfaction I greeted
him by this name as soon as he was born. It is easy to see how the father's
suppressed desire for greatness is, in his thoughts, transferred to his
children; one is inclined to believe that this is one of the ways by which
the suppression of this desire (which becomes necessary in the course of
life) is effected. The little fellow won his right to inclusion in the
text of this dream by virtue of the fact that the same accident- that of
soiling his clothes (quite pardonable in either a child or in a dying person)-
had occurred to him. Compare with this the allusion Stuhlrichter (presiding
judge) and the wish of the dream: to stand before one's children great
and undefiled.

<P>&nbsp;5. If I should now have to look for examples of judgments or expressions
of opinion which remain in the dream itself, and are not continued in,
or transferred to, our waking thoughts, my task would be greatly facilitated
were I to take my examples from dreams which have already been cited for
other purposes. The dream of Goethe's attack on Herr M appears to contain
quite a number of acts of judgment. I try to elucidate the temporal relations
a little, as they seem improbable to me. Does not this look like a critical
impulse directed against the nonsensical idea that Goethe should have made
a literary attack upon a young man of my acquaintance? It seems plausible
to me that he was 18 years old. That sounds quite like the result of a
calculation, though a silly one; and the I do not know exactly what is
the date of the present year would be an example of uncertainty or doubt
in dreams.

<P>&nbsp;But I know from analysis that these acts of judgment, which seem
to have been performed in the dream for the first time, admit of a different
construction, in the light of which they become indispensable for interpreting
the dream, while at the same time all absurdity is avoided. With the sentence
I try to elucidate the temporal relations a little, I put myself in the
place of my friend, who is actually trying to elucidate the temporal relations
of life. The sentence then loses its significance as a judgment which objects
to the nonsense of the previous sentences. The interposition, Which seems
improbable to me, belongs to the following: It seems plausible to me. With
almost these identical words I replied to the lady who told me of her brother's
illness: "It seems improbable to me" that the cry of "Nature, Nature,"
was in any way connected with Goethe; it seems much more plausible to me
that it has the sexual significance which is known to you. In this case,
it is true, a judgment was expressed, but in reality, not in a dream, and
on an occasion which is remembered and utilized by the dream-thoughts.
The dream-content appropriates this judgment like any other fragment of
the dream-thoughts.

<P>&nbsp;The number 18 with which the judgment in the dream is meaninglessly
connected still retains a trace of the context from which the real judgment
was taken. Lastly, the I do not know exactly what is the date of the present
year is intended for no other purpose than that of my identification with
the paralytic, in examining whom this particular fact was established.

<P>&nbsp;In the solution of these apparent acts of judgment in dreams,
it will be well to keep in mind the above-mentioned rule of interpretation,
which tells us that we must disregard the coherence which is established
in the dream between its constituent parts as an unessential phenomenon,
and that every dream-element must be taken separately and traced back to
its source. The dream is a compound, which for the purposes of investigation
must be broken up into its elements. On the other hand, we become alive
to the fact that there is a psychic force which expresses itself in our
dreams and establishes this apparent coherence; that is, the material obtained
by the dream- work undergoes a secondary elaboration. Here we have the
manifestations of that psychic force which we shall presently take into
consideration as the fourth of the factors which co- operate in dream-formation.

<P>&nbsp;6. Let us now look for other examples of acts of judgment in the
dreams which have already been cited. In the absurd dream about the communication
from the town council, I ask the question, "You married soon after?" I
reckon that I was born in 1856, which seems to me to be directly afterwards.
This certainly takes the form of an inference. My father married shortly
after his attack, in the year 1851. I am the eldest son, born in 1856;
so this is correct. We know that this inference has in fact been falsified
by the wish-fulfilment, and that the sentence which dominates the dream-thoughts
is as follows: Four or five years- that is no time at all- that need not
be counted. But every part of this chain of reasoning may be seen to be
otherwise determined from the dream- thoughts, as regards both its content
and its form. It is the patient of whose patience my colleague complains
who intends to marry immediately the treatment is ended. The manner in
which I converse with my father in this dream reminds me of an examination
or cross-examination, and thus of a university professor who was in the
habit of compiling a complete docket of personal data when entering his
pupils' names: You were born when?- 1856.- Patre?- Then the applicant gave
the Latin form of the baptismal name of the father and we students assumed
that the Hofrat drew inferences from the father's name which the baptismal
name of the candidate would not always have justified. Hence, the drawing
of inferences in the dream would be merely the repetition of the drawing
of inferences which appears as a scrap of material in the dream-thoughts.
From this we learn something new. If an inference occurs in the dream-content,
it assuredly comes from the dream-thoughts; but it may be contained in
these as a fragment of remembered material, or it may serve as the logical
connective of a series of dream-thoughts. In any case, an inference in
the dream represents an inference taken from the dream-thoughts. *

<P>* These results correct at several points my earlier statements concerning
the representation of logical relations (chapter VI., C.). These described
the general procedure of the dream-work, but overlooked its most delicate
and most careful operations.

<P>It will be well to continue the analysis of this dream at this point.
With the inquisition of the professor is associated the recollection of
an index (in my time published in Latin) of the university students; and
further, the recollection of my own course of study. The five years allowed
for the study of medicine were, as usual, too little for me. I worked unconcernedly
for some years longer; my acquaintances regarded me as a loafer, and doubted
whether I should get through. Then, suddenly, I decided to take my examinations,
and I got through in spite of the postponement. A fresh confirmation of
the dream-thoughts with which I defiantly meet my critics: "Even though
you won't believe it, because I am taking my time, I shall reach the conclusion
(German, Schluss = end, conclusion, inference). It has often happened like
that."

<P>&nbsp;In its introductory portion, this dream contains several sentences
which, we can hardly deny, are of the nature of an argument. And this argument
is not at all absurd; it might just as well occur in my waking thoughts.
In my dream I make fun of the communication from the town council, for
in the first place I was not yet born in 1851, and in the second place
my father, to whom it might refer, is already dead. Not only is each of
these statements perfectly correct in itself, but they are the very arguments
that I should employ if I received such a communication. We know from the
foregoing analysis that this dream has sprung from the soil of deeply embittered
and scornful dream-thoughts; and if we may also assume that the motive
of the censorship is a very powerful one, we shall understand that the
dream-thought has every occasion to create a flawless refutation of an
unreasonable demand, in accordance with the pattern contained in the dream-thoughts.
But the analysis shows that in this case the dream-work has not been required
to make a free imitation, but that material taken from the dream-thoughts
had to be employed for the purpose. It is as though in an algebraic equation
there should occur, besides the figures, plus and minus signs, and symbols
of powers and of roots, and as though someone, in copying this equation,
without understanding it, should copy both the symbols and the figures,
and mix them all up together. The two arguments may be traced to the following
material: It is painful to me to think that many of the hypotheses upon
which I base my psychological solution of the psychoneuroses which will
arouse scepticism and ridicule when they first become known. For instance,
I shall have to assert that impressions of the second year of life, and
even the first, leave an enduring trace upon the emotional life of subsequent
neuropaths, and that these impressions- although greatly distorted and
exaggerated by the memory- may furnish the earliest and profoundest basis
of a hysterical symptom. Patients to whom I explain this at a suitable
moment are wont to parody my explanation by offering to search for reminiscences
of the period when they were not yet born. My disclosure of the unsuspected
part played by the father in the earliest sexual impulses of female patients
may well have a similar reception. (Cf. the discussion in chapter V., D).
Nevertheless, it is my well-founded conviction that both doctrines are
true. In confirmation of this I recall certain examples in which the death
of the father occurred when the child was very young, and subsequent incidents,
otherwise inexplicable, proved that the child had unconsciously reserved
recollections of the person who had so early gone out of its life. I know
that both my assertions are based upon inferences whose validity will be
attacked. It is the doing of the wish-fulfilment that precisely the material
of those inferences, which I fear will be contested, should be utilized
by the dream-work for establishing incontestable conclusions.

<P>&nbsp;7. In one dream, which I have hitherto only touched upon, astonishment
at the subject emerging is distinctly expressed at the outset.

<P>&nbsp;The elder Brucke must have set me some task or other; strangely
enough, it relates to the preparation of the lower part of my own body,
the pelvis and legs, which I see before me as though in the dissecting-room,
but without feeling the absence of part of my body, and without a trace
of horror. Louise N is standing beside me, and helps me in the work. The
pelvis is eviscerated; now the upper, now the lower aspect is visible,
and the two aspects are commingled. Large fleshy red tubercles are visible
(which, even in the dream, make me think of haemorrhoids). Also something
lying over them had to be carefully picked off; it looked like crumpled
tinfoil. * Then I was once more in possession of my legs, and I made a
journey through the city, but I took a cab (as I was tired). To my astonishment,
the cab drove into the front door of a house, which opened and allowed
it to pass into a corridor, which was broken off at the end, and eventually
led on into the open. *(2) Finally I wandered through changing landscapes,
with an Alpine guide, who carried my things. He carried me for some distance,
out of consideration for my tired legs. The ground was swampy; we went
along the edge; people were sitting on the ground, like Red Indians or
gypsies; among them a girl. Until then I had made my way along on the slippery
ground, in constant astonishment that I was so well able to do so after
making the preparation. At last we came to a small wooden house with an
open window at one end. Here the guide set me down, and laid two planks,
which stood in readiness, on the window-sill so as to bridge the chasm
which had to be crossed from the window. Now I grew really alarmed about
my legs. Instead of the expected crossing, I saw two grown-up men lying
upon wooden benches which were fixed on the walls of the hut, and something
like two sleeping children next to them; as though not the planks but the
children were intended to make the crossing possible. I awoke with terrified
thoughts.

<P>* Stanniol, allusion to Stannius; the nervous system of fishes; cf chapter
VI., F.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) The place in the corridor of my apartment-house where the
perambulators of the other tenants stand; it is also otherwise hyper-determined
several times over.

<P>Anyone who his been duly impressed by the extensive nature of dream-condensation
will readily imagine what a number of pages the exhaustive analysis of
this dream would fill. Fortunately for the context, I shall make this dream
only the one example of astonishment in dreams, which makes its appearance
in the parenthetical remark, strangely enough. Let us consider the occasion
of the dream. It is a visit of this lady, Louise N, who helps me with my
work in the dream. She says: "Lend me something to read." I offer her She,
by Rider Haggard. A strange book, but full of hidden meaning," I try to
explain; "the eternal feminine, the immortality of our emotions-" Here
she interrupts me: "I know that book already. Haven't you something of
your own?" "No, my own immortal works are still unwritten." "Well, when
are you going to publish your so-called 'latest revelations,' which, you
promised us, even we should be able to read?" she asks, rather sarcastically.
I now perceive that she is a mouthpiece for someone else, and I am silent.
I think of the effort it cost me to make public even my work on dreams,
in which I had to surrender so much of my own intimate nature. ("The best
that you know you can't tell the boys.") The preparation of my own body
which I am ordered to make in my dream is thus the self-analysis involved
in the communication of my dreams. The elder Brucke very properly finds
a place here; in the first years of my scientific work it so happened that
I neglected the publication of a certain discovery until his insistence
forced me to publish it. But the further trains of thought, proceeding
from my conversation with Louise N, go too deep to become conscious; they
are side-tracked by way of the material which has been incidentally awakened
in me by the mention of Rider Haggard's She. The comment strangely enough
applies to this book, and to another by the same author, The Heart of the
World; and numerous elements of the dream are taken from these two fantastic
romances. The swampy ground over which the dreamer is carried, the chasm
which has to be crossed by means of planks, come from She; the Red Indians,
the girl, and the wooden house, from The Heart of the World. In both novels
a woman is the leader, and both treat of perilous wanderings; She has to
do with an adventurous journey to an undiscovered country, a place almost
untrodden by the foot of man. According to a note which I find in my record
of the dream, the fatigue in my legs was a real sensation from those days.
Probably a weary mood corresponded with this fatigue, and the doubting
question: "How much farther will my legs carry me?" In She, the end of
the adventure is that the heroine meets her death in the mysterious central
fire, instead of winning immortality for herself and for others. Some related
anxiety has mistakably arisen in the dream- thoughts. The wooden house
is assuredly also a coffin- that is, the grave. But in representing this
most unwished-for of all thoughts by means of a wish-fulfilment, the dream-work
has achieved its masterpiece. I was once in a grave, but it was an empty
Etruscan grave near Orvieto- a narrow chamber with two stone benches on
the walls, upon which were lying the skeletons of two adults. The interior
of the wooden house in the dream looks exactly like this grave, except
that stone has been replaced by wood. The dream seems to say: "If you must
already sojourn in your grave, let it be this Etruscan grave," and by means
of this interpolation it transforms the most mournful expectation into
one that is really to be desired. Unfortunately, as we shall learn, the
dream is able to change into its opposite only the idea accompanying an
affect, but not always the affect itself. Hence, I awake with thoughts
of terror, even after the idea that perhaps my children will achieve what
has been denied to their father has forced its way to representation: a
fresh allusion to the strange romance in which the identity of a character
is preserved through a series of generations covering two thousand years.

<P>&nbsp;8. in the context of another dream there is a similar expression
of astonishment at what is experienced in the dream. This, however, is
connected with such a striking, far-fetched, and almost intellectual attempt
at explanation that if only on this account I should have to subject the
whole dream to analysis, even if it did not possess two other interesting
features. On the night of the eighteenth of July I was travelling on the
Southern Railway, and in my sleep I heard someone call out: "Hollthurn,
10 minutes." I immediately think of Holothuria- of a natural history museum-
that here is a place where valiant men have vainly resisted the domination
of their overlord.- Yes, the counter- reformation in Austria!- As though
it were a place in Styria or the Tyrol. Now I see indistinctly a small
museum, in which the relics of the acquisitions of these men are preserved.
I should like to leave the train, but I hesitate to do so. There are women
with fruit on the platform; they squat on the ground, and in that position
invitingly hold up their baskets.- I hesitated, in doubt as to whether
we have time, but here we are still stationary.- I am suddenly in another
compartment in which the leather and the seats are so narrow that one's
spine directly touches the back. * I am surprised at this, but I may have
changed carriages while asleep. Several people, among them an English brother
and sister; a row of books plainly on a shelf on the wall.- I see The Wealth
of Nations, and Matter and Motion (by Maxwell), thick books bound in brown
linen. The man asks his sister about a book of Schiller's, whether she
has forgotten it. These books seem to belong now to me, now to them. At
this point I wish to join in the conversation in order to confirm or support
what is being said. I wake sweating all over, because all the windows are
shut, The train stops at Marburg.

<P>* This description is not intelligible even to myself, but I follow
the principle of reproducing the dream in those words which occur to me
while I am writing it down. The wording itself is a part of the dream-representation.

<P>While writing down the dream, a part of it occurs to me which my memory
wished to pass over. I tell the brother and sister (in English), referring
to a certain book: "It is from..." but I correct myself: "It is by..."
The man remarks to his sister: "He said it correctly."

<P>&nbsp;The dream begins with the name of a station, which seems to have
almost waked me. For this name, which was Marburg, I substitute Hollthurn.
The fact that I heard Marburg the first, or perhaps the second time it
was called out, is proved by the mention of Schiller in the dream; he was
born in Marburg, though not the Styrian Marburg. * Now on this occasion,
although I was travelling first class, I was doing so under very disagreeable
circumstances. The train was overcrowded; in my compartment I had come
upon a lady and gentleman who seemed very fine people, and had not the
good breeding, or did not think it worth while, to conceal their displeasure
at my intrusion. My polite greeting was not returned, and although they
were sitting side by side (with their backs to the engine), the woman before
my eyes hastened to pre-empt the seat opposite her, and next to the window,
with her umbrella; the door was immediately closed, and pointed remarks
about the opening of windows were exchanged. Probably I was quickly recognized
as a person hungry for fresh air. It was a hot night, and the atmosphere
of the compartment, closed on both sides, was almost suffocating. My experience
as a traveller leads me to believe that such inconsiderate and overbearing
conduct marks people who have paid for their tickets only partly, or not
at all. When the conductor came round, and I presented my dearly bought
ticket, the lady exclaimed haughtily and almost threateningly: "My husband
has a pass." She was an imposing- looking person, with a discontented expression,
in age not far removed from the autumn of feminine beauty; the man had
no chance to say anything; he sat there motionless. I tried to sleep. In
my dream I take a terrible revenge on my disagreeable travelling companions;
no one would suspect what insults and humiliations are concealed behind
the disjointed fragments of the first half of the dream. After this need
has been satisfied, the second wish, to exchange my compartment for another,
makes itself felt. The dream changes its scene so often, and without making
the slightest objection to such changes, that it would not have seemed
at all remarkable had I at once, from my memories, replaced my travelling
companions by more agreeable persons. But here was a case where something
or other opposes the change of scene, and finds it necessary to explain
it. How did I suddenly get into another compartment? I could not positively
remember having changed carriages. So there was only one explanation. I
must have left the carriage while asleep- an unusual occurrence, examples
of which, however, are known to neuropathologists. We know of persons who
undertake railway journeys in a crepuscular state, without betraying their
abnormal condition by any sign whatever, until at some stage of their journey
they come to themselves, and are surprised by the gap in their memory.
Thus, while I am still dreaming, I declare my own case to be such a case
of automatisme ambulatoire.

<P>* Schiller was not born in one of the Marbergs, but in Marbach, as every
German schoolboy knows, and I myself knew. This again is one of those errors
(Cf. chapter VI., B) which creep in as substitutes for an intentional falsification
in another place and which I have endeavoured to explain in The Psycho-pathology
of Everyday Life.

<P>Analysis permits of another solution. The attempt at explanation, which
so surprises me if I am to attribute it to the dream-work, is not original,
but is copied from the neurosis of one of my patients. I have already spoken
in another chapter of a highly cultured and kindly man who began, shortly
after the death of his parents, to accuse himself of murderous tendencies,
and who was distressed by the precautionary measures which he had to take
to secure himself against these tendencies. His was a case of severe obsessional
ideas with full insight. To begin with, it was painful to him to walk through
the streets, as he was obsessed by the necessity of accounting for all
the persons he met; he had to know whither they had disappeared; if one
of them suddenly eluded his pursuing glance, he was left with a feeling
of distress and the idea that he might possibly have made away with the
man. Behind this obsessive idea was concealed, among other things, a Cain-phantasy,
for "all men are brothers." Owing to the impossibility of accomplishing
this task, he gave up going for walks, and spent his life imprisoned within
his four walls. But reports of murders which had been committed in the
world outside were constantly reaching his room by way of the newspapers,
and his conscience tormented him with the doubt that he might be the murderer
for whom the police were looking. The certainty that he had not left the
house for weeks protected him for a time against these accusations, until
one day there dawned upon him the possibility that he might have left his
house while in an unconscious state, and might thus have committed murder
without knowing anything about it. From that time onwards he locked his
front door, and gave the key to his old housekeeper, strictly forbidding
her to give it into his hands, even if he demanded it.

<P>&nbsp;This, then, is the origin of the attempted explanation that I
may have changed carriages while in an unconscious state; it has been taken
into the dream ready-made, from the material of the dream- thoughts, and
is evidently intended to identify me with the person of my patient. My
memory of this patient was awakened by natural association. My last night
journey had been made a few weeks earlier in his company. He was cured,
and we were going into the country together to his relatives, who had sent
for me; as we had a compartment to ourselves, we left all the windows open
throughout the night, and for as long as I remained awake we had a most
interesting conversation. I knew that hostile impulses towards his father
in childhood, in a sexual connection, had been at the root of his illness.
By identifying myself with him, I wanted to make an analogous confession
to myself. The second scene of the dream really resolves itself into a
wanton phantasy to the effect that my two elderly travelling companions
had acted so uncivilly towards me because my arrival on the scene had prevented
them from exchanging kisses and embraces during the night, as they had
intended. This phantasy, however, goes back to an early incident of my
childhood when, probably impelled by sexual curiosity, I had intruded into
my parents' bedroom, and was driven thence by my father's emphatic command.

<P>&nbsp;I think it would be superfluous to multiply such examples. They
would all confirm what we have learned from those already cited: namely,
that an act of judgment in a dream is merely the repetition of an original
act of judgment in the dream-thoughts. In most cases it is an unsuitable
repetition, fitted into an inappropriate context; occasionally, however,
as in our last example, it is so artfully applied that it may almost give
one the impression of independent intellectual activity in the dream. At
this point we might turn our attention to that psychic activity which,
though it does not appear to co-operate constantly in the formation of
dreams, yet endeavours to fuse the dream-elements of different origin into
a flawless and significant whole. We consider it necessary, however, first
of all to consider the expressions of affect which appear in dreams, and
to compare these with the affects which analysis discovers in the dream-thoughts.
