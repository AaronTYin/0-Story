VI. THE DREAM-WORK</H2></CENTER>
ALL other previous attempts to solve the problems of dreams have concerned
themselves directly with the manifest dream-content as it is retained in
the memory. They have sought to obtain an interpretation of the dream from
this content, or, if they dispensed with an interpretation, to base their
conclusions concerning the dream on the evidence provided by this content.
We, however, are confronted by a different set of data; for us a new psychic
material interposes itself between the dream-content and the results of
our investigations: the latent dream-content, or dream-thoughts, which
are obtained only by our method. We develop the solution of the dream from
this latent content, and not from the manifest dream-content. We are thus
confronted with a new problem, an entirely novel task- that of examining
and tracing the relations between the latent dream-thoughts and the manifest
dream-content, and the processes by which the latter has grown out of the
former.

<P>&nbsp;The dream-thoughts and the dream-content present themselves as
two descriptions of the same content in two different languages; or, to
put it more clearly, the dream-content appears to us as a translation of
the dream-thoughts into another mode of expression, whose symbols and laws
of composition we must learn by comparing the origin with the translation.
The dream-thoughts we can understand without further trouble the moment
we have ascertained them. The dream-content is, as it were, presented in
hieroglyphics, whose symbols must be translated, one by one, into the language
of the dream-thoughts. It would of course, be incorrect to attempt to read
these symbols in accordance with their values as pictures, instead of in
accordance with their meaning as symbols. For instance, I have before me
a picture- puzzle (rebus)- a house, upon whose roof there is a boat; then
a single letter; then a running figure, whose head has been omitted, and
so on. As a critic I might be tempted to judge this composition and its
elements to be nonsensical. A boat is out of place on the roof of a house,
and a headless man cannot run; the man, too, is larger than the house,
and if the whole thing is meant to represent a landscape the single letters
have no right in it, since they do not occur in nature. A correct judgment
of the picture-puzzle is possible only if I make no such objections to
the whole and its parts, and if, on the contrary, I take the trouble to
replace each image by a syllable or word which it may represent by virtue
of some allusion or relation. The words thus put together are no longer
meaningless, but might constitute the most beautiful and pregnant aphorism.
Now a dream is such a picture-puzzle, and our predecessors in the art of
dream- interpretation have made the mistake of judging the rebus as an
artistic composition. As such, of course, it appears nonsensical and worthless.

<H3>
A. Condensation</H3>
The first thing that becomes clear to the investigator when he compares
the dream-content with the dream-thoughts is that a tremendous work of
condensation has been accomplished. The dream is meagre, paltry and laconic
in comparison with the range and copiousness of the dream-thoughts. The
dream, when written down fills half a page; the analysis, which contains
the dream- thoughts, requires six, eight, twelve times as much space. The
ratio varies with different dreams; but in my experience it is always of
the same order. As a rule, the extent of the compression which has been
accomplished is under-estimated, owing to the fact that the dream-thoughts
which have been brought to light are believed to be the whole of the material,
whereas a continuation of the work of interpretation would reveal still
further thoughts hidden in the dream. We have already found it necessary
to remark that one can never be really sure that one has interpreted a
dream completely; even if the solution seems satisfying and flawless, it
is always possible that yet another meaning has been manifested by the
same dream. Thus the degree of condensation is- strictly speaking- indeterminable.
Exception may be taken- and at first sight the objection seems perfectly
plausible- to the assertion that the disproportion between dream- content
and dream-thoughts justifies the conclusion that a considerable condensation
of psychic material occurs in the formation of dreams. For we often have
the feeling that we have been dreaming a great deal all night, and have
then forgotten most of what we have dreamed. The dream which we remember
on waking would thus appear to be merely a remnant of the dream- work,
which would surely equal the dream-thoughts in range if only we could remember
it completely. To a certain extent this is undoubtedly true; there is no
getting away from the fact that a dream is most accurately reproduced if
we try to remember it immediately after waking, and that the recollection
of it becomes more and more defective as the day goes on. On the other
hand, it has to be recognized that the impression that we have dreamed
a good deal more than we are able to reproduce is very often based on an
illusion, the origin of which we shall explain later on. Moreover, the
assumption of a condensation in the dream-work is not affected by the possibility
of forgetting a part of dreams, for it may be demonstrated by the multitude
of ideas pertaining to those individual parts of the dream which do remain
in the memory. If a large part of the dream has really escaped the memory,
we are probably deprived of access to a new series of dream-thoughts. We
have no justification for expecting that those portions of the dream which
have been lost should likewise have referred only to those thoughts which
we know from the analysis of the portions which have been preserved. *

<P>* References to the condensation in dreams are to be found in the works
of many writers on the subject. Du Prel states in his Philosophie der Mystik
that he is absolutely certain that a condensation-process of the succession
of ideas had occurred. -

<P>In view of the very great number of ideas which analysis elicits for
each individual element of the dream-content, the principal doubt in the
minds of many readers will be whether it is permissible to count everything
that subsequently occurs to the mind during analysis as forming part of
the dream-thoughts- in other words, to assume that all these thoughts have
been active in the sleeping state, and have taken part in the formation
of the dream. Is it not more probable that new combinations of thoughts
are developed in the course of analysis, which did not participate in the
formation of the dream? To this objection I can give only a conditional
reply. It is true, of course, that separate combinations of thoughts make
their first appearance during the analysis; but one can convince oneself
every time this happens that such new combinations have been established
only between thoughts which have already been connected in other ways in
the dream-thoughts; the new combinations are, so to speak, corollaries,
short-circuits, which are made possible by the existence of other, more
fundamental modes of connection. In respect of the great majority of the
groups of thoughts revealed by analysis, we are obliged to admit that they
have already been active in the formation of the dream, for if we work
through a succession of such thoughts, which at first sight seem to have
played no part in the formation of the dream, we suddenly come upon a thought
which occurs in the dream-content, and is indispensable to its interpretation,
but which is nevertheless inaccessible except through this chain of thoughts.
The reader may here turn to the dream of the botanical monograph, which
is obviously the result of an astonishing degree of condensation, even
though I have not given the complete analysis.

<P>&nbsp;But how, then, are we to imagine the psychic condition of the
sleeper which precedes dreaming? Do all the dream-thoughts exist side by
side, or do they pursue one another, or are there several simultaneous
trains of thought, proceeding from different centres, which subsequently
meet? I do not think it is necessary at this point to form a plastic conception
of the psychic condition at the time of dream-formation. But let us not
forget that we are concerned with unconscious thinking, and that the process
may easily be different from that which we observe in ourselves in deliberate
contemplation accompanied by consciousness.

<P>&nbsp;The fact, however, is irrefutable that dream-formation is based
on a process of condensation. How, then, is this condensation effected?

<P>&nbsp;Now, if we consider that of the dream-thoughts ascertained only
the most restricted number are represented in the dream by means of one
of their conceptual elements, we might conclude that the condensation is
accomplished by means of omission, inasmuch as the dream is not a faithful
translation or projection, point by point, of the dream-thoughts, but a
very incomplete and defective reproduction of them. This view, as we shall
soon perceive, is a very inadequate one. But for the present let us take
it as a point of departure, and ask ourselves: If only a few of the elements
of the dream-thoughts make their way into the dream- content, what are
the conditions that determine their selection?

<P>&nbsp;In order to solve this problem, let us turn our attention to those
elements of the dream-content which must have fulfilled the conditions
for which we are looking. The most suitable material for this investigation
will be a dream to whose formation a particularly intense condensation
has contributed. I select the dream, cited in chapter V., of the botanical
monograph.
<H4>
I.</H4>
Dream-content: I have written a monograph upon a certain (indeterminate)
species of plant. The book lies before me. I am just turning over a folded
coloured plate. A dried specimen of the plant is bound up in this copy,
as in a herbarium.

<P>&nbsp;The most prominent element of this dream is the botanical monograph.
This is derived from the impressions of the dream-day; I had actually seen
a monograph on the genus Cyclamen in a bookseller's window. The mention
of this genus is lacking in the dream-content; only the monograph and its
relation to botany have remained. The botanical monograph immediately reveals
its relation to the work on cocaine which I once wrote; from cocaine the
train of thought proceeds on the one hand to a Festschrift, and on the
other to my friend, the oculist, Dr. Koenigstein, who was partly responsible
for the introduction of cocaine as a local anaesthetic. Moreover, Dr. Koenigstein
is connected with the recollection of an interrupted conversation I had
had with him on the previous evening, and with all sorts of ideas relating
to the remuneration of medical and surgical services among colleagues.
This conversation, then, is the actual dream-stimulus; the monograph on
cyclamen is also a real incident, but one of an indifferent nature; as
I now see, the botanical monograph of the dream proves to be a common mean
between the two experiences of the day, taken over unchanged from an indifferent
impression, and bound with the psychically significant experience by means
of the most copious associations.

<P>&nbsp;Not only the combined idea of the botanical monograph, however,
but also each of its separate elements, botanical and monograph, penetrates
farther and farther, by manifold associations, into the confused tangle
of the dream-thoughts. To botanical belong the recollections of the person
of Professor Gartner (German: Gartner = gardener), of his blooming wife,
of my patient, whose name is Flora, and of a lady concerning whom I told
the story of the forgotten flowers. Gartner, again, leads me to the laboratory
and the conversation with Koenigstein; and the allusion to the two female
patients belongs to the same conversation. From the lady with the flowers
a train of thoughts branches off to the favourite flowers of my wife, whose
other branch leads to the title of the hastily seen monograph. Further,
botanical recalls an episode at the Gymnasium, and a university examination;
and a fresh subject- that of my hobbies- which was broached in the above-mentioned
conversation, is linked up, by means of what is humorously called my favourite
flower, the artichoke, with the train of thoughts proceeding from the forgotten
flowers; behind artichoke there lies, on the one hand, a recollection of
Italy, and on the other a reminiscence of a scene of my childhood, in which
I first formed an acquaintance- which has since then grown so intimate-
with books. Botanical, then, is a veritable nucleus, and, for the dream,
the meeting-point of many trains of thought; which, I can testify, had
all really been brought into connection by the conversation referred to.
Here we find ourselves in a thought-factory, in which, as in The Weaver's
Masterpiece:

<P>The little shuttles to and fro

<P>&nbsp;Fly, and the threads unnoted flow;

<P>&nbsp;One throw links up a thousand threads.

<P>Monograph in the dream, again, touches two themes: the one-sided nature
of my studies, and the costliness of my hobbies.

<P>&nbsp;The impression derived from this first investigation is that the
elements botanical and monograph were taken up into the dream- content
because they were able to offer the most numerous points of contact with
the greatest number of dream-thoughts, and thus represented nodal points
at which a great number of the dream- thoughts met together, and because
they were of manifold significance in respect of the meaning of the dream.
The fact upon which this explanation is based may be expressed in another
form: Every element of the dream-content proves to be over- determined-
that is, it appears several times over in the dream- thoughts.

<P>&nbsp;We shall learn more if we examine the other components of the
dream in respect of their occurrence in the dream-thoughts. The coloured
plate refers (cf. the analysis in chapter V.) to a new subject, the criticism
passed upon my work by colleagues, and also to a subject already represented
in the dream- my hobbies- and, further, to a memory of my childhood, in
which I pull to pieces a book with coloured plates; the dried specimen
of the plant relates to my experience with the herbarium at the Gymnasium,
and gives this memory particular emphasis. Thus I perceive the nature of
the relation between the dream-content and dream-thoughts: Not only are
the elements of the dream determined several times over by the dream-thoughts,
but the individual dream-thoughts are represented in the dream by several
elements. Starting from an element of the dream, the path of the association
leads to a number of dream-thoughts; and from a single dream-thought to
several elements of the dream. In the process of dream-formation, therefore,
it is not the case that a single dream-thought, or a group of dream-thoughts,
supplies the dream-content with an abbreviation of itself as its representative,
and that the next dream-thought supplies another abbreviation as its representative
(much as representatives are elected from among the population); but rather
that the whole mass of the dream-thoughts is subjected to a certain elaboration,
in the course of which those elements that receive the strongest and completest
support stand out in relief; so that the process might perhaps be likened
to election by the scrutin du liste. Whatever dream I may subject to such
a dissection, I always find the same fundamental principle confirmed- that
the dream-elements have been formed out of the whole mass of the dream-thoughts,
and that every one of them appears, in relation to the dream- thoughts,
to have a multiple determination.

<P>&nbsp;It is certainly not superfluous to demonstrate this relation of
the dream-content to the dream-thoughts by means of a further example,
which is distinguished by a particularly artful intertwining of reciprocal
relations. The dream is that of a patient whom I am treating for claustrophobia
(fear of enclosed spaces). It will soon become evident why I feel myself
called upon to entitle this exceptionally clever piece of dream- activity:
<H4>
II. "A Beautiful Dream"</H4>
The dreamer is driving with a great number of companions in X- street,
where there is a modest hostelry (which is not the case). A theatrical
performance is being given in one of the rooms of the inn. He is first
spectator, then actor. Finally the company is told to change their clothes,
in order to return to the city. Some of the company are shown into rooms
on the ground floor, others to rooms on the first floor. Then a dispute
arises. The people upstairs are annoyed because those downstairs have not
yet finished changing, so that they cannot come down. His brother is upstairs;
he is downstairs; and he is angry with his brother because they are so
hurried. (This part obscure.) Besides, it was already decided, upon their
arrival, who was to go upstairs and who down. Then he goes alone up the
hill towards the city, and he walks so heavily, and with such difficulty,
that he cannot move from the spot. An elderly gentleman joins him and talks
angrily of the King of Italy. Finally, towards the top of the hill, he
is able to walk much more easily.

<P>&nbsp;The difficulty experienced in climbing the hill was so distinct
that for some time after waking he was in doubt whether the experience
was a dream or the reality.

<P>&nbsp;Judged by the manifest content, this dream can hardly be eulogized.
Contrary to the rules, I shall begin the interpretation with that portion
to which the dreamer referred as being the most distinct.

<P>&nbsp;The difficulty dreamed of, and probably experienced during the
dream- difficulty in climbing, accompanied by dyspnoea- was one of the
symptoms which the patient had actually exhibited some years before, and
which, in conjunction with other symptoms, was at the time attributed to
tuberculosis (probably hysterically simulated). From our study of exhibition-dreams
we are already acquainted with this sensation of being inhibited in motion,
peculiar to dreams, and here again we find it utilized as material always
available for the purposes of any other kind of representation. The part
of the dream-content which represents climbing as difficult at first, and
easier at the top of the hill, made me think, while it was being related,
of the well- known masterly introduction to Daudet's Sappho. Here a young
man carries the woman he loves upstairs; she is at first as light as a
feather, but the higher he climbs the more she weighs; and this scene is
symbolic of the process of their relation, in describing which Daudet seeks
to admonish young men not to lavish an earnest affection upon girls of
humble origin and dubious antecedents. * Although I knew that my patient
had recently had a love-affair with an actress, and had broken it off,
I hardly expected to find that the interpretation which had occurred to
me was correct. The situation in Sappho is actually the reverse of that
in the dream; for in the dream climbing was difficult at the first and
easy later on; in the novel the symbolism is pertinent only if what was
at first easily carried finally proves to be a heavy burden. To my astonishment,
the patient remarked that the interpretation fitted in very well with the
plot of a play which he had seen the previous evening. The play was called
Rund um Wien (Round about Vienna), and treated of the career of a girl
who was at first respectable, but who subsequently lapsed into the demimonde,
and formed relations with highly-placed lovers, thereby climbing, but finally
she went downhill faster and faster. This play reminded him of another,
entitled Von Stufe zu Stufe (From Step to Step), the poster advertising
which had depicted a flight of stairs. -

<P>* In estimating the significance of this passage we may recall the meaning
of dreams of climbing stairs, as explained in the chapter on Symbolism.

<P>To continue the interpretation: The actress with whom he had had his
most recent and complicated affair had lived in X-street. There is no inn
in this street. However, while he was spending part of the summer in Vienna
for the sake of this lady, he had lodged (German: abgestiegen = stopped,
literally stepped off) at a small hotel in the neighbourhood. When he was
leaving the hotel, he said to the cab-driver: "I am glad at all events
that I didn't get any vermin here!" (Incidentally, the dread of vermin
is one of his phobias.) Whereupon the cab-driver answered: "How could anybody
stop there! That isn't a hotel at all, it's really nothing but a pub!"

<P>&nbsp;The pub immediately reminded him of a quotation:

<P>Of a wonderful host

<P>&nbsp;I was lately a guest.

<P>But the host in the poem by Uhland is an apple-tree. Now a second quotation
continues the train of thought:

<P>FAUST (dancing with the young witch).

<P>&nbsp;A lovely dream once came to me;

<P>&nbsp;I then beheld an apple-tree,

<P>&nbsp;And there two fairest apples shone:

<P>&nbsp;They lured me so, I climbed thereon.

<P>THE FAIR ONE

<P>&nbsp;Apples have been desired by you,

<P>&nbsp;Since first in Paradise they grew;

<P>&nbsp;And I am moved with joy to know

<P>&nbsp;That such within my garden grow. *

<P>* Faust I.

<P>There is not the slightest doubt what is meant by the apple-tree and
the apples. A beautiful bosom stood high among the charms by which the
actress had bewitched our dreamer.

<P>&nbsp;Judging from the context of the analysis, we had every reason
to assume that the dream referred to an impression of the dreamer's childhood.
If this is correct, it must have referred to the wet- nurse of the dreamer,
who is now a man of nearly thirty years of age. The bosom of the nurse
is in reality an inn for the child. The nurse, as well as Daudet's Sappho,
appears as an allusion to his recently abandoned mistress.

<P>&nbsp;The (elder) brother of the patient also appears in the dream-
content; he is upstairs, while the dreamer himself is downstairs. This
again is an inversion, for the brother, as I happen to know, has lost his
social position, while my patient has retained his. In relating the dream-content,
the dreamer avoided saying that his brother was upstairs and that he himself
was downstairs. This would have been to obvious an expression, for in Austria
we say that a man is on the ground floor when he has lost his fortune and
social position, just as we say that he has come down. Now the fact that
at this point in the dream something is represented as inverted must have
a meaning; and the inversion must apply to some other relation between
the dream-thoughts and the dream- content. There is an indication which
suggests how this inversion is to be understood. It obviously applies to
the end of the dream, where the circumstances of climbing are the reverse
of those described in Sappho. Now it is evident what inversion is meant:
In Sappho the man carries the woman who stands in a sexual relation to
him; in the dream-thoughts, conversely, there is a reference to a woman
carrying a man: and, as this could occur only in childhood, the reference
is once more to the nurse who carries the heavy child. Thus the final portion
of the dream succeeds in representing Sappho and the nurse in the same
allusion.

<P>&nbsp;Just as the name Sappho has not been selected by the poet without
reference to a Lesbian practise, so the portions of the dream in which
people are busy upstairs and downstairs, above and beneath, point to fancies
of a sexual content with which the dreamer is occupied, and which, as suppressed
cravings, are not unconnected with his neurosis. Dream-interpretation itself
does not show that these are fancies and not memories of actual happenings;
it only furnishes us with a set of thoughts and leaves it to us to determine
their actual value. In this case real and imagined happenings appear at
first as of equal value- and not only here, but also in the creation of
more important psychic structures than dreams. A large company, as we already
know, signifies a secret. The brother is none other than a representative,
drawn into the scenes of childhood by fancying backwards, of all of the
subsequent for women's favours. Through the medium of an experience indifferent
in itself, the episode of the gentleman who talks angrily of the King of
Italy refers to the intrusion of people of low rank into aristocratic society.
It is as though the warning which Daudet gives to young men were to be
supplemented by a similar warning applicable to a suckling child. *

<P>* The fantastic nature of the situation relating to the dreamer's wet-nurse
is shown by the circumstance, objectively ascertained, that the nurse in
this case was his mother. Further, I may call attention to the regret of
the young man in the anecdote related to p. 222 above (that he had not
taken better advantage of his opportunities with his wet-nurse) as the
probable source of his dream.

<P>In the two dreams here cited I have shown by italics where one of the
elements of the dream recurs in the dream-thoughts, in order to make the
multiple relations of the former more obvious. Since, however, the analysis
of these dreams has not been carried to completion, it will probably be
worth while to consider a dream with a full analysis, in order to demonstrate
the manifold determination of the dream-content. For this purpose I shall
select the dream of Irma's injection (see chapter II). From this example
we shall readily see that the condensation-work in the dream-formation
has made use of more means than one.

<P>&nbsp;The chief person in the dream-content is my patient Irma, who
is seen with the features which belong to her waking life, and who therefore,
in the first instance, represents herself. But her attitude, as I examine
her at the window, is taken from a recollection of another person, of the
lady for whom I should like to exchange my patient, as is shown by the
dream-thoughts. Inasmuch as Irma has a diphtheritic membrane, which recalls
my anxiety about my eldest daughter, she comes to represent this child
of mine, behind whom, connected with her by the identity of their names,
is concealed the person of the patient who died from the effects of poison.
In the further course of the dream the Significance of Irma's personality
changes (without the alteration of her image as it is seen in the dream):
she becomes one of the children whom we examine in the public dispensaries
for children's diseases, where my friends display the differences in their
mental capacities. The transition was obviously effected by the idea of
my little daughter. Owing to her unwillingness to open her mouth, the same
Irma constitutes an allusion to another lady who was examined by me, and,
also in the same connection, to my wife. Further, in the morbid changes
which I discover in her throat I have summarized allusions to quite a number
of other persons.

<P>&nbsp;All these people whom I encounter as I follow up the associations
suggested by Irma do not appear personally in the dream; they are concealed
behind the dream-person Irma, who is thus developed into a collective image,
which, as might be expected, has contradictory features. Irma comes to
represent these other persons, who are discarded in the work of condensation,
inasmuch as I allow anything to happen to her which reminds me of these
persons, trait by trait.

<P>&nbsp;For the purposes of dream-condensation I may construct a composite
person in yet another fashion, by combining the actual features of two
or more persons in a single dream-image. It is in this fashion that the
Dr. M of my dream was constructed; he bears the name of Dr. M, and he speaks
and acts as Dr. M does, but his bodily characteristics and his malady belong
to another person, my eldest brother; a single feature, paleness, is doubly
determined, owing to the fact that it is common to both persons. Dr. R,
in my dream about my uncle, is a similar composite person. But here the
dream-image is constructed in yet another fashion. I have not united features
peculiar to the one person with the features of the other, thereby abridging
by certain features the memory-picture of each; but I have adopted the
method employed by Galton in producing family portraits; namely, I have
superimposed the two images, so that the common features stand out in stronger
relief, while those which do not coincide neutralize one another and become
indistinct. In the dream of my uncle the fair beard stands out in relief,
as an emphasized feature, from a physiognomy which belongs to two persons,
and which is consequently blurred; further, in its reference to growing
grey the beard contains an allusion to my father and to myself.

<P>&nbsp;The construction of collective and composite persons is one of
the principal methods of dream-condensation. We shall presently have occasion
to deal with this in another connection.

<P>&nbsp;The notion of dysentry in the dream of Irma's injection has likewise
a multiple determination; on the one hand, because of its paraphasic assonance
with diphtheria. and on the other because of its reference to the patient
whom I sent to the East, and whose hysteria had been wrongly diagnosed.

<P>&nbsp;The mention of propyls in the dream proves again to be an interesting
case of condensation. Not propyls but amyls were included in the dream-thoughts.
One might think that here a simple displacement had occured in the course
of dream-formation. This is in fact the case, but the displacement serves
the purposes of the condensation, as is shown from the following supplementary
analysis: If I dwell for a moment upon the word propylen (German) its assonance
with the word propylaeum suggests itself to me. But a propylaeum is to
be found not only in Athens, but also in Munich. In the latter city, a
year before my dream, I had visited a friend who was seriously ill, and
the reference to him in trimethylamin, which follows closely upon propyls,
is unmistakable.

<P>&nbsp;I pass over the striking circumstance that here, as elsewhere
in the analysis of dreams, associations of the most widely differing values
are employed for making thought-connections as though they were equivalent,
and I yield to the temptation to regard the procedure by which amyls in
the dream-thoughts are replaced in the dream-content by propyls as a sort
of plastic process.

<P>&nbsp;On the one hand, here is the group of ideas relating to my friend
Otto, who does not understand me, thinks I am in the wrong, and gives me
the liqueur that smells of amyls; on the other hand, there is the group
of ideas- connected with the first by contrast- relating to my Berlin friend
who does understand me, who would always think that I was right, and to
whom I am indebted for so much valuable information concerning the chemistry
of sexual processes.

<P>&nbsp;What elements in the Otto group are to attract my particular attention
are determined by the recent circumstances which are responsible for the
dream; amyls belong to the element so distinguished, which are predestined
to find their way into the dream-content. The large group of ideas centering
upon William is actually stimulated by the contrast between William and
Otto, and those elements in it are emphasized which are in tune with those
already stirred up in the Otto group. In the whole of this dream I am continually
recoiling from somebody who excites my displeasure towards another person
with whom I can at will confront the first; trait by trait I appeal to
the friend as against the enemy. Thus amyls in the Otto group awakes recollections
in the other group, also belonging to the region of chemistry; trimethylamin,
which receives support from several quarters, finds its way into the dream-content.
Amyls, too, might have got into the dream-content unchanged, but it yields
to the influence of the William group, inasmuch as out of the whole range
of recollections covered by this name an element is sought out which is
able to furnish a double determination for amyls. Propyls is closely associated
with amyls; from the William group comes Munich with its propylaeum. Both
groups are united in propyls- propylaeum. As though by a compromise, this
intermediate element then makes its way into the dream-content. Here a
common mean which permits of a multiple determination has been created.
It thus becomes palpable that a multiple determination must facilitate
penetration into the dream-content. For the purpose of this mean-formation
a displacement of the attention has been unhesitatingly effected from what
is really intended to something adjacent to it in the associations.

<P>&nbsp;The study of the dream of Irma's injection has now enabled us
to obtain some insight into the process of condensation which occurs in
the formation of dreams. We perceive, as peculiarities of the condensing
process, a selection of those elements which occur several times over in
the dream-content, the formation of new unities (composite persons, mixed
images), and the production of common means. The purpose which is served
by condensation, and the means by which it is brought about, will be investigated
when we come to study in all their bearings the psychic processes at work
in the formation of dreams. Let us for the present be content with establishing
the fact of dream-condensation as a relation between the dream-thoughts
and the dream-content which deserves attention.

<P>&nbsp;The condensation-work of dreams becomes most palpable when it
takes words and means as its objects. Generally speaking, words are often
treated in dreams as things, and therefore undergo the same combinations
as the ideas of things. The results of such dreams are comical and bizarre
word-formations.

<P>&nbsp;1. A colleague sent an essay of his, in which he had, in my opinion,
overestimated the value of a recent physiological discovery, and had expressed
himself, moreover, in extravagant terms. On the following night I dreamed
a sentence which obviously referred to this essay: "That is a truly norekdal
style." The solution of this word-formation at first gave me some difficulty;
it was unquestionably formed as a parody of the superlatives colossal,
pyramidal; but it was not easy to say where it came from. At last the monster
fell apart into the two names Nora and Ekdal, from two well-known plays
by Ibsen. I had previously read a newspaper article on Ibsen by the writer
whose latest work I was now criticizing in my dream.

<P>&nbsp;2. One of my female patients dreams that a man with a fair beard
and a peculiar glittering eye is pointing to a sign-board attached to a
tree which reads: uclamparia- wet. *

<P>* Given by translator, as the author's example could not be translated.

<P>Analysis.- The man was rather authoritative-looking, and his peculiar
glittering eye at once recalled the church of San Paolo, near Rome, where
she had seen the mosaic portraits of the Popes. One of the early Popes
had a golden eye (this is really an optical illusion, to which the guides
usually call attention). Further associations showed that the general physiognomy
of the man corresponded with her own clergyman (pope), and the shape of
the fair beard recalled her doctor (myself), while the stature of the man
in the dream recalled her father. All these persons stand in the same relation
to her; they are all guiding and directing the course of her life. On further
questioning, the golden eye recalled gold- money- the rather expensive
psycho-analytic treatment, which gives her a great deal of concern. Gold,
moreover, recalls the gold cure for alcoholism- Herr D, whom she would
have married, if it had not been for his clinging to the disgusting alcohol
habit- she does not object to anyone's taking an occasional drink; she
herself sometimes drinks beer and liqueurs. This again brings her back
to her visit to San Paolo (fuori la mura) and its surroundings. She remembers
that in the neighbouring monastery of the Tre Fontane she drank a liqueur
made of eucalyptus by the Trappist monks of the monastery. She then relates
how the monks transformed this malarial and swampy region into a dry and
wholesome neighbourhood by planting numbers of eucalyptus trees. The word
uclamparia then resolves itself into eucalyptus and malaria, and the word
wet refers to the former swampy nature of the locality. Wet also suggests
dry. Dry is actually the name of the man whom she would have married but
for his over-indulgence in alcohol. The peculiar name of Dry is of Germanic
origin (drei = three) and hence, alludes to the monastery of the Three
(drei) Fountains. In talking of Mr. Dry's habit she used the strong expression:
"He could drink a fountain." Mr. Dry jocosely refers to his habit by saying:
"You know I must drink because I am always dry" (referring to his name).
The eucalyptus refers also to her neurosis, which was at first diagnosed
as malaria. She went to Italy because her attacks of anxiety, which were
accompanied by marked rigors and shivering, were thought to be of malarial
origin. She bought some eucalyptus oil from the monks, and she maintains
that it has done her much good.

<P>&nbsp;The condensation uclamparia- wet is, therefore, the point of junction
for the dream as well as for the neurosis.

<P>&nbsp;3. In a rather long and confused dream of my own, the apparent
nucleus of which is a sea-voyage, it occurs to me that the next port is
Hearsing, and next after that Fliess. The latter is the name of my friend
in B, to which city I have often journeyed. But Hearsing is put together
from the names of the places in the neighbourhood of Vienna, which so frequently
end in "ing": Hietzing, Liesing, Moedling (the old Medelitz, meae deliciae,
my joy; that is, my own name, the German for joy being Freude), and the
English hearsay, which points to calumny, and establishes the relation
to the indifferent dream-stimulus of the day- a poem in Fliegende Blatter
about a slanderous dwarf, Sagter Hatergesagt (Saidhe Hashesaid). By the
combination of the final syllable ing with the name Fliess, Vlissingen
is obtained, which is a real port through which my brother passes when
he comes to visit us from England. But the English for Vlissingen is Flushing,
which signifies blushing, and recalls patients suffering from erythrophobia
(fear of blushing), whom I sometimes treat, and also a recent publication
of Bechterew's, relating to this neurosis, the reading of which angered
me. *

<P>* The same analysis and synthesis of syllables- a veritable chemistry
of syllables- serves us for many a jest in waking life. "What is the cheapest
method of obtaining silver? You go to a field where silverberries are growing
and pick them; then the berries are eliminated and the silver remains in
a free state." [Translator's example]. The first person who read and criticized
this book made the objection- with which other readers will probably agree-
that "the dreamer often appears too witty." That is true, so long as it
applies to the dreamer; it involves a condemnation only when its application
is extended to the interpreter of the dream. In waking reality I can make
very little claim to the predicate witty; if my dreams appear witty, this
is not the fault of my individuality, but of the peculiar psychological
conditions under which the dream is fabricated, and is intimately connected
with the theory of wit and the comical. The dream becomes witty because
the shortest and most direct way to the expression of its thoughts is barred
for it: the dream is under constraint. My readers may convince themselves
that the dreams of my patients give the impression of being quite as witty
(at least, in intention), as my own, and even more so. Nevertheless, this
reproach impelled me to compare the technique of wit with the dream-work.

<P>4. Upon another occasion I had a dream which consisted of two separate
parts. The first was the vividly remembered word Autodidasker: the second
was a faithful reproduction in the dream- content of a short and harmless
fancy which had been developed a few days earlier, and which was to the
effect that I must tell Professor N, when I next saw him: "The patient
about whose condition I last consulted you is really suffering from a neurosis,
just as you suspected." So not only must the newly- coined Autodidasker
satisfy the requirement that it should contain or represent a compressed
meaning, but this meaning must have a valid connection with my resolve-
repeated from waking life- to give Professor N due credit for his diagnosis.

<P>&nbsp;Now Autodidasker is easily separated into author (German, Autor),
autodidact, and Lasker, with whom is associated the name Lasalle. The first
of these words leads to the occasion of the dream- which this time is significant.
I had brought home to my wife several volumes by a well-known author who
is a friend of my brother's, and who, as I have learned, comes from the
same neighbourhood as myself (J. J. David). One evening she told me how
profoundly impressed she had been by the pathetic sadness of a story in
one of David's novels (a story of wasted talents), and our conversation
turned upon the signs of talent which we perceive in our own children.
Under the influence of what she had just read, my wife expressed some concern
about our children, and I comforted her with the remark that precisely
such dangers as she feared can be averted by training. During the night
my thoughts proceeded farther, took up my wife's concern for the children,
and interwove with it all sorts of other things. Something which the novelist
had said to my brother on the subject of marriage showed my thoughts a
by-path which might lead to representation in the dream. This path led
to Breslau; a lady who was a very good friend of ours had married and gone
to live there. I found in Breslau Lasker and Lasalle, two examples to justify
the fear lest our boys should be ruined by women, examples which enabled
me to represent simultaneously two ways of influencing a man to his undoing.
* The Cherchez la femme, by which these thoughts may be summarized, leads
me, if taken in another sense, to my brother, who is still married and
whose name is Alexander. Now I see that Alex, as we abbreviate the name,
sounds almost like an inversion of Lasker, and that this fact must have
contributed to send my thoughts on a detour by way of Breslau.

<P>* Lasker died of progressive paralysis; that is, of the consequences
of an infection caught from a woman (syphilis); Lasalle, also a syphilitic,
was killed in a duel which he fought on account of the lady whom he had
been courting.

<P>But the playing with names and syllables in which I am here engaged
has yet another meaning. It represents the wish that my brother may enjoy
a happy family life, and this in the following manner: In the novel of
artistic life, L'OEuvre, which, by virtue of its content, must have been
in association with my dream- thoughts, the author, as is well-known, has
incidentally given a description of his own person and his own domestic
happiness, and appears under the name of Sandoz. In the metamorphosis of
his name he probably went to work as follows: Zola, when inverted (as children
are fond of inverting names) gives Aloz. But this was still too undisguised;
he therefore replaced the syllable Al, which stands at the beginning of
the name Alexander, by the third syllable of the same name, sand, and thus
arrived at Sandoz. My autodidasker originated in a similar fashion.

<P>&nbsp;My phantasy- that I am telling Professor N that the patient whom
we have both seen is suffering from a neurosis- found its way into the
dream in the following manner: Shortly before the close of my working year,
I had a patient in whose case my powers of diagnosis failed me. A serious
organic trouble- possibly some alterative degeneration of the spinal cord-
was to be assumed, but could not be conclusively demonstrated. It would
have been tempting to diagnose the trouble as a neurosis, and this would
have put an end to all my difficulties, but for the fact that the sexual
anamnesis, failing which I am unwilling to admit a neurosis, was so energetically
denied by the patient. In my embarrassment I called to my assistance the
physician whom I respect most of all men (as others do also), and to whose
authority I surrender most completely. He listened to my doubts, told me
he thought them justified, and then said: "Keep on observing the man, it
is probably a neurosis." Since I know that he does not share my opinions
concerning the aetiology of the neuroses, I refrained from contradicting
him, but I did not conceal my scepticism. A few days later I informed the
patient that I did not know what to do with him, and advised him to go
to someone else. Thereupon, to my great astonishment, he began to beg my
pardon for having lied to me: he had felt so ashamed; and now he revealed
to me just that piece of sexual aetiology which I had expected, and which
I found necessary for assuming the existence of a neurosis. This was a
relief to me, but at the same time a humiliation; for I had to admit that
my consultant, who was not disconcerted by the absence of anamnesis, had
judged the case more correctly. I made up my mind to tell him, when next
I saw him, that he had been right and I had been wrong.

<P>&nbsp;This is just what I do in the dream. But what sort of a wish is
fulfilled if I acknowledge that I am mistaken? This is precisely my wish;
I wish to be mistaken as regards my fears- that is to say, I wish that
my wife, whose fears I have appropriated in my dream-thoughts, may prove
to be mistaken. The subject to which the fact of being right or wrong is
related in the dream is not far removed from that which is really of interest
to the dream- thoughts. We have the same pair of alternatives, of either
organic or functional impairment caused by a woman, or actually by the
sexual life- either tabetic paralysis or a neurosis- with which latter
the nature of Lasalle's undoing is indirectly connected.

<P>&nbsp;In this well-constructed (and on careful analysis quite transparent)
dream, Professor N appears not merely on account of this analogy, and my
wish to be proved mistaken, or the associated references to Breslau and
to the family of our married friend who lives there, but also on account
of the following little dialogue which followed our consultation: After
he had acquitted himself of his professional duties by making the above-
mentioned suggestion, Dr. N proceeded to discuss personal matters. "How
many children have you now?"- "Six."- A thoughtful and respectful gesture.-
"Girls, boys?"- "Three of each. They are my pride and my riches."- "Well,
you must be careful; there is no difficulty about the girls, but the boys
are a difficulty later on as regards their upbringing." I replied that
until now they had been very tractable; obviously this prognosis of my
boys' future pleased me as little as his diagnosis of my patient, whom
he believed to be suffering only from a neurosis. These two impressions,
then, are connected by their continuity, by their being successively received;
and when I incorporate the story of the neurosis into the dream, I substitute
it for the conversation on the subject of upbringing, which is even more
closely connected with the dream-thoughts, since it touches so closely
upon the anxiety subsequently expressed by my wife. Thus, even my fear
that N may prove to be right in his remarks on the difficulties to be met
with in bringing up boys is admitted into the dream-content, inasmuch as
it is concealed behind the representation of my wish that I may be wrong
to harbour such apprehensions. The same phantasy serves without alteration
to represent both the conflicting alternatives.

<P>&nbsp;Examination-dreams present the same difficulties to interpretation
that I have already described as characteristic of most typical dreams.
The associative material which the dreamer supplies only rarely suffices
for interpretation. A deeper understanding of such dreams has to be accumulated
from a considerable number of examples. Not long ago I arrived at a conviction
that reassurances like "But you already are a doctor," and so on, not only
convey a consolation but imply a reproach as well. This would have run:
"You are already so old, so far advanced in life, and yet you still commit
such follies, are guilty of such childish behaviour." This mixture of self-
criticism and consolation would correspond with the examination- dreams.
After this it is no longer surprising that the reproaches in the last analysed
examples concerning follies and childish behaviour should relate to repetitions
of reprehensible sexual acts.

<P>&nbsp;The verbal transformations in dreams are very similar to those
which are known to occur in paranoia, and which are observed also in hysteria
and obsessions. The linguistic tricks of children, who at a certain age
actually treat words as objects, and even invent new languages and artificial
syntaxes, are a common source of such occurrences both in dreams and in
the psychoneuroses.

<P>&nbsp;The analysis of nonsensical word-formations in dreams is particularly
well suited to demonstrate the degree of condensation effected in the dream-work.
From the small number of the selected examples here considered it must
not be concluded that such material is seldom observed or is at all exceptional.
It is, on the contrary, very frequent, but, owing to the dependence of
dream interpretation on psychoanalytic treatment, very few examples are
noted down and reported, and most of the analyses which are reported are
comprehensible only to the specialist in neuropathology.

<P>&nbsp;When a spoken utterance, expressly distinguished as such from
a thought, occurs in a dream, it is an invariable rule that the dream-speech
has originated from a remembered speech in the dream- material. The wording
of the speech has either been preserved in its entirety or has been slightly
altered in expression. frequently the dream-speech is pieced together from
different recollections of spoken remarks; the wording has remained the
same, but the sense has perhaps become ambiguous, or differs from the wording.
Not infrequently the dream-speech serves merely as an allusion to an incident
in connection with which the remembered speech was made. *

<P>* In the case of a young man who was suffering from obsessions, but
whose intellectual functions were intact and highly developed, I recently
found the only exception to this rule. The speeches which occurred in his
dreams did not originate in speeches which he had heard had made himself,
but corresponded to the undistorted verbal expression of his obsessive
thoughts, which came to his waking consciousness only in an altered form.

<P>&nbsp;
<H3>
B. The Work of Displacement</H3>
Another and probably no less significant relation must have already forced
itself upon our attention while we were collecting examples of dream-condensation.
We may have noticed that these elements which obtrude themselves in the
dream-content as its essential components do not by any means play this
same part in the dream-thoughts. As a corollary to this, the converse of
this statement is also true. That which is obviously the essential content
of the dream-thoughts need not be represented at all in the dream. The
dream is, as it were, centred elsewhere; its content is arranged about
elements which do not constitute the central point of the dream-thoughts.
Thus, for example, in the dream of the botanical monograph the central
point of the dream- content is evidently the element botanical; in the
dream- thoughts, we are concerned with the complications and conflicts
resulting from services rendered between colleagues which place them under
mutual obligations; later on with the reproach that I am in the habit of
sacrificing too much time to my hobbies; and the element botanical finds
no place in this nucleus of the dream- thoughts, unless it is loosely connected
with it by antithesis, for botany was never among my favourite subjects.
In the Sappho- dream of my patient, ascending and descending, being upstairs
and down, is made the central point; the dream, however, is concerned with
the danger of sexual relations with persons of low degree; so that only
one of the elements of the dream-thoughts seems to have found its way into
the dream-content, and this is unduly expanded. Again, in the dream of
my uncle, the fair beard, which seems to be its central point, appears
to have no rational connection with the desire for greatness which we have
recognized as the nucleus of the dream-thoughts. Such dreams very naturally
give us an impression of a displacement. In complete contrast to these
examples, the dream of Irma's injection shows that individual elements
may claim the same place in dream-formation as that which they occupy in
the dream-thoughts. The recognition of this new and utterly inconstant
relation between the dream- thoughts and the dream-content will probably
astonish us at first. If we find, in a psychic process of normal life,
that one idea has been selected from among a number of others, and has
acquired a particular emphasis in our consciousness, we are wont to regard
this as proof that a peculiar psychic value (a certain degree of interest)
attaches to the victorious idea. We now discover that this value of the
individual element in the dream- thoughts is not retained in dream-formation,
or is not taken into account. For there is no doubt which of the elements
of the dream- thoughts are of the highest value; our judgment informs us
immediately. In dream-formation the essential elements, those that are
emphasized by intensive interest, may be treated as though they were subordinate,
while they are replaced in the dream by other elements, which were certainly
subordinate in the dream-thoughts. It seems at first as though the psychic
intensity * of individual ideas were of no account in their selection for
dream-formation, but only their greater or lesser multiplicity of determination.
One might be inclined to think that what gets into the dream is not what
is important in the dream-thoughts, but what is contained in them several
times over; but our understanding of dream-formation is not much advanced
by this assumption; to begin with, we cannot believe that the two motives
of multiple determination and intrinsic value can influence the selection
of the dream otherwise than in the same direction. Those ideas in the dream-thoughts
which are most important are probably also those which recur most frequently,
since the individual dream-thoughts radiate from them as centres. And yet
the dream may reject these intensely emphasized and extensively reinforced
elements, and may take up into its content other elements which are only
extensively reinforced.

<P>* The psychic intensity or value of an idea- the emphasis due to interest-
is of course to be distinguished from perceptual or conceptual intensity.

<P>This difficulty may be solved if we follow up yet another impression
received during the investigation of the over- determination of the dream-content.
Many readers of this investigation may already have decided, in their own
minds, that the discovery of the multiple determination of the dream-elements
is of no great importance, because it is inevitable. Since in analysis
we proceed from the dream-elements, and register all the ideas which associate
themselves with these elements, is it any wonder that these elements should
recur with peculiar frequency in the thought-material obtained in this
manner? While I cannot admit the validity of this objection, I am now going
to say something that sounds rather like it: Among the thoughts which analysis
brings to light are many which are far removed from the nucleus of the
dream, and which stand out like artificial interpolations made for a definite
purpose. Their purpose may readily be detected; they establish a connection,
often a forced and far-fetched connection, between the dream-content and
the dream-thoughts, and in many cases, if these elements were weeded out
of the analysis, the components of the dream-content would not only not
be over-determined, but they would not be sufficiently determined. We are
thus led to the conclusion that multiple determination, decisive as regards
the selection made by the dream, is perhaps not always a primary factor
in dream- formation, but is often a secondary product of a psychic force
which is as yet unknown to us. Nevertheless, it must be of importance for
the entrance of the individual elements into the dream, for we may observe
that, in cases where multiple determination does not proceed easily from
the dream-material, it is brought about with a certain effort.

<P>&nbsp;It now becomes very probable that a psychic force expresses itself
in the dream-work which, on the one hand, strips the elements of the high
psychic value of their intensity and, on the other hand, by means of over-determination,
creates new significant values from elements of slight value, which new
values then make their way into the dream-content. Now if this is the method
of procedure, there has occurred in the process of dream-formation a transference
and displacement of the psychic intensities of the individual elements,
from which results the textual difference between the dream-content and
the thought- content. The process which we here assume to be operative
is actually the most essential part of the dream-work; it may fitly be
called dream-displacement. Dream-displacement and dream- condensation are
the two craftsmen to whom we may chiefly ascribe the structure of the dream.

<P>&nbsp;I think it will be easy to recognize the psychic force which expresses
itself in dream-displacement. The result of this displacement is that the
dream-content no longer has any likeness to the nucleus of the dream-thoughts,
and the dream reproduces only a distorted form of the dream-wish in the
unconscious. But we are already acquainted with dream-distortion; we have
traced it back to the censorship which one psychic instance in the psychic
life exercises over another. Dream-displacement is one of the chief means
of achieving this distortion. Is fecit, cui profuit. * We must assume that
dream-displacement is brought about by the influence of this censorship,
the endopsychic defence. *(2)

<P>* "The doer gained."

<P>&nbsp;*(2) Since I regard the attribution of dream-distortion to the
censorship as the central point of my conception of the dream, I will here
quote the closing passage of a story, Traumen wie Wachen, from Phantasien
eines Realisten, by Lynkeus (Vienna, second edition [1900]), in which I
find this chief feature of my doctrine reproduced:

<P>&nbsp;"Concerning a man who possesses the remarkable faculty of never
dreaming nonsense...."

<P>&nbsp;"Your marvellous faculty of dreaming as if you were awake is based
upon your virtues, upon your goodness, your justice, and your love of truth;
it is the moral clarity of your nature which makes everything about you
intelligible to me."

<P>&nbsp;"But if I really give thought to the matter," was the reply, "I
almost believe that all men are made as I am, and that no one ever dreams
nonsense! A dream which one remembers so distinctly that one can relate
it afterwards, and which, therefore, is no dream of delirium, always has
a meaning; why, it cannot be otherwise! For that which is in contradiction
to itself can never be combined into a whole. The fact that time and space
are often thoroughly shaken up, detracts not at all from the real content
of the dream, because both are without any significance whatever for its
essential content. We often do the same thing in waking life; think of
fairy-tales, of so many bold and pregnant creations of fantasy, of which
only a foolish person would say: 'That is nonsense! For it isn't possible.'"

<P>&nbsp;"If only it were always possible to interpret dreams correctly,
as you have just done with mine!" said the friend.

<P>&nbsp;"That is certainly not an easy task, but with a little attention
it must always be possible to the dreamer. You ask why it is generally
impossible? In your case there seems to be something veiled in your dreams,
something unchaste in a special and exalted fashion, a certain secrecy
in your nature, which it is difficult to fathom; and that is why your dreams
so often seem to be without meaning, or even nonsensical. But in the profoundest
sense, this is by no means the case; indeed it cannot be, for a man is
always the same person, whether he wakes or dreams."

<P>The manner in which the factors of displacement, condensation and over-determination
interact with one another in dream-formation- which is the ruling factor
and which the subordinate one- all this will be reserved as a subject for
later investigation. In the meantime, we may state, is a second condition
which the elements that find their way into the dream must satisfy, that
they must be withdrawn from the resistance of the censorship. But henceforth,
in the interpretation of dreams, we shall reckon with dream-displacement
as an unquestionable fact.
