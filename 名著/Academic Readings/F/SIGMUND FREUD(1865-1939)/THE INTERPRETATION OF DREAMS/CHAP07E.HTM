E. The Primary and Secondary Processes. Repression</H3>
In attempting to penetrate more profoundly into the psychology of the dream-processes,
I have undertaken a difficult task, to which, indeed, my powers of exposition
are hardly adequate. To reproduce the simultaneity of so complicated a
scheme in terms of a successive description, and at the same time to make
each part appear free from all assumptions, goes fairly beyond my powers.
I have now to atone for the fact that in my exposition of the psychology
of dreams I have been unable to follow the historic development of my own
insight. The lines of approach to the comprehension of the dream were laid
down for me by previous investigations into the psychology of the neuroses,
to which I should not refer here, although I am constantly obliged to do
so; whereas I should like to work in the opposite direction, starting from
the dream, and then proceeding to establish its junction with the psychology
of the neuroses. I am conscious of all the difficulties which this involves
for the reader, but I know of no way to avoid them.

<P>&nbsp;Since I am dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I am glad
to dwell upon another point of view, which would seem to enhance the value
of my efforts. As was shown in the introductory section, I found myself
confronted with a theme which had been marked by the sharpest contradictions
on the part of those who had written on it. In the course of our treatment
of the problems of the dream, room has been found for most of these contradictory
views. We have been compelled to take decided exception to two only of
the views expressed: namely, that the dream is a meaningless process, and
that it is a somatic process. Apart from these, we have been able to find
a place for the truth of all the contradictory opinions at one point or
another of the complicated tissue of the facts, and we have been able to
show that each expressed something genuine and correct. That our dreams
continue the impulses and interests of waking life has been generally confirmed
by the discovery of the hidden dream-thoughts. These concern themselves
only with things that seem to us important and of great interest. Dreams
never occupy themselves with trifles. But we have accepted also the opposite
view, namely, that the dream gathers up the indifferent residues of the
day, and cannot seize upon any important interest of the day until it has
in some measure withdrawn itself from waking activity. We have found that
this holds true of the dream-content, which by means of distortion gives
the dream-thought an altered expression. We have said that the dream-process,
owing to the nature of the mechanism of association, finds it easier to
obtain possession of recent or indifferent material, which has not yet
been put under an embargo by our waking mental activity; and that, on account
of the censorship, it transfers the psychic intensity of the significant
but also objectionable material to the indifferent. The hypermnesia of
the dream and its ability to dispose of infantile material have become
the main foundations of our doctrine; in our theory of dreams we have assigned
to a wish of infantile origin the part of the indispensable motive-power
of dream-formation. It has not, of course, occurred to us to doubt the
experimentally demonstrated significance of external sensory stimuli during
sleep; but we have placed this material in the same relation to the dream-wish
as the thought-residues left over from our waking activity. We need not
dispute the fact that the dream interprets objective sensory stimuli after
the manner of an illusion; but we have supplied the motive for this interpretation,
which has been left indeterminate by other writers. The interpretation
proceeds in such a way that the perceived object is rendered harmless as
a source of disturbance of sleep, whilst it is made usable for the wish-fulfilment.
Though we do not admit as a special source of dreams the subjective state
of excitation of the sensory organs during sleep (which seems to have been
demonstrated by Trumbull Ladd), we are, nevertheless, able to explain this
state of excitation by the regressive revival of the memories active behind
the dream. As to the internal organic sensations, which are wont to be
taken as the cardinal point of the explanation of dreams, these, too, find
a place in our conception, though indeed a more modest one. These sensations-
the sensations of falling, of soaring, or of being inhibited- represent
an ever-ready material, which the dream-work can employ to express the
dream- thought as often as need arises.

<P>&nbsp;That the dream-process is a rapid and momentary one is, we believe,
true as regards the perception by consciousness of the preformed dream-content;
but we have found that the preceding portions of the dream-process probably
follow a slow, fluctuating course. As for the riddle of the superabundant
dream-content compressed into the briefest moment of time, we have been
able to contribute the explanation that the dream seizes upon ready-made
formations of the psychic life. We have found that it is true that dreams
are distorted and mutilated by the memory, but that this fact presents
no difficulties, as it is only the last manifest portion of a process of
distortion which has been going on from the very beginning of the dream-work.
In the embittered controversy, which has seemed irreconcilable, whether
the psychic life is asleep at night, or can make the same use of all its
faculties as during the day, we have been able to conclude that both sides
are right, but that neither is entirely so. In the dream-thoughts we found
evidence of a highly complicated intellectual activity, operating with
almost all the resources of the psychic apparatus; yet it cannot be denied
that these dream- thoughts have originated during the day, and it is indispensable
to assume that there is a sleeping state of the psychic life. Thus, even
the doctrine of partial sleep received its due, but we have found the characteristic
feature of the sleeping state not in the disintegration of the psychic
system of connections, but in the special attitude adopted by the psychic
system which is dominant during the day- the attitude of the wish to sleep.
The deflection from the outer world retains its significance for our view,
too; though not the only factor at work, it helps to make possible the
regressive course of the dream-representation. The abandonment of voluntary
guidance of the flow of ideas is incontestable; but psychic life does not
thereby become aimless, for we have seen that upon relinquishment of the
voluntary directing ideas, involuntary ones take charge. On the other hand,
we have not only recognized the loose associative connection of the dream,
but have brought a far greater area within the scope of this kind of connection
than could have been suspected; we have, however, found it merely an enforced
substitute for another, a correct and significant type of association.
To be sure, we too have called the dream absurd, but examples have shown
us how wise the dream is when it simulates absurdity. As regards the functions
that have been attributed to the dream, we are able to accept them all.
That the dream relieves the mind, like a safety-valve, and that, as Robert
has put it, all kinds of harmful material are rendered harmless by representation
in the dream, not only coincides exactly with our own theory of the twofold
wish-fulfilment in the dream, but in its very wording becomes more intelligible
for us than it is for Robert himself. The free indulgence of the psyche
in the play of its faculties is reproduced in our theory as the non-interference
of the preconscious activity with the dream. The return of the embryonal
standpoint of psychic life in the dream, and Havelock Ellis's remark that
the dream is "an archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect thoughts,"
appear to us as happy anticipations of our own exposition, which asserts
that primitive modes of operations that are suppressed during the day play
a part in the formation of dreams. We can fully identify ourselves with
Sully's statement, that "our dreams bring back again our earlier and successively
developed personalities, our old ways of regarding things, with impulses
and modes of reaction which ruled us long ago"; and for us, as for Delage,
the suppressed material becomes the mainspring of the dream.

<P>&nbsp;We have fully accepted the role that Scherner ascribes to the
dream-phantasy, and his own interpretations, but we have been obliged to
transpose them, as it were, to another part of the problem. It is not the
dream that creates the phantasy, but the activity of unconscious phantasy
that plays the leading part in the formation of the dream-thoughts. We
remain indebted to Scherner for directing us to the source of the dream-thoughts,
but almost everything that he ascribes to the dream-work is attributable
to the activity of the unconscious during the day, which instigates dreams
no less than neurotic symptoms. The dream- work we had to separate from
this activity as something quite different and far more closely controlled.
Finally, we have by no means renounced the relation of the dream to psychic
disturbances, but have given it, on new ground, a more solid foundation.

<P>&nbsp;Held together by the new features in our theory as by a superior
unity, we find the most varied and most contradictory conclusions of other
writers fitting into our structure; many of them are given a different
turn, but only a few of them are wholly rejected. But our own structure
is still unfinished. For apart from the many obscure questions in which
we have involved ourselves by our advance into the dark regions of psychology,
we are now, it would seem, embarrassed by a new contradiction. On the one
hand, we have made it appear that the dream-thoughts proceed from perfectly
normal psychic activities, but on the other hand we have found among the
dream-thoughts a number of entirely abnormal mental processes, which extend
also to the dream-content, and which we reproduce in the interpretation
of the dream. All that we have termed the dream-work seems to depart so
completely from the psychic processes which we recognize as correct and
appropriate that the severest judgments expressed by the writers mentioned
as to the low level of psychic achievement of dreams must appear well founded.

<P>&nbsp;Here, perhaps, only further investigations can provide an explanation
and set us on the right path. Let me pick out for renewed attention one
of the constellations which lead to dream- formation.

<P>&nbsp;We have learned that the dream serves as a substitute for a number
of thoughts derived from our daily life, and which fit together with perfect
logic. We cannot, therefore, doubt that these thoughts have their own origin
in our normal mental life. All the qualities which we value in our thought-processes,
and which mark them out as complicated performances of a high order, we
shall find repeated in the dream-thoughts. There is, however, no need to
assume that this mental work is performed during sleep; such an assumption
would badly confuse the conception of the psychic state of sleep to which
we have hitherto adhered. On the contrary, these thoughts may very well
have their origin in the daytime, and, unremarked by our consciousness,
may have gone on from their first stimulus until, at the onset of sleep,
they have reached completion. If we are to conclude anything from this
state of affairs, it can only be that it proves that the most complex mental
operations are possible without the cooperation of consciousness- a truth
which we have had to learn anyhow from every psycho-analysis of a patient
suffering from hysteria or obsessions. These dream-thoughts are certainly
not in themselves incapable of consciousness; if we have not become conscious
of them during the day, this may have been due to various reasons. The
act of becoming conscious depends upon a definite psychic function- attention-
being brought to bear. This seems to be available only in a determinate
quantity, which may have been diverted from the train of thought in question
by other aims. Another way in which such trains of thought may be withheld
from consciousness is the following: From our conscious reflection we know
that, when applying our attention, we follow a particular course. But if
that course leads us to an idea which cannot withstand criticism, we break
off and allow the cathexis of attention to drop. Now, it would seem that
the train of thought thus started and abandoned may continue to develop
without our attention returning to it, unless at some point it attains
a specially high intensity which compels attention. An initial conscious
rejection by our judgment, on the ground of incorrectness or uselessness
for the immediate purpose of the act of thought, may, therefore, be the
cause of a thought-process going on unnoticed by consciousness until the
onset of sleep.

<P>&nbsp;Let us now recapitulate: We call such a train of thought a preconscious
train, and we believe it to be perfectly correct, and that it may equally
well be a merely neglected train or one that has been interrupted and suppressed.
Let us also state in plain terms how we visualize the movement of our thought.
We believe that a certain quantity of excitation, which we call cathectic
energy, is displaced from a purposive idea along the association paths
selected by this directing idea. A neglected train of thought has received
no such cathexis, and the cathexis has been withdrawn from one that was
suppressed or rejected; both have thus been left to their own excitations.
The train of thought cathected by some aim becomes able under certain conditions
to attract the attention of consciousness, and by the mediation of consciousness
it then receives hyper-cathexis. We shall be obliged presently to elucidate
our assumptions as to the nature and function of consciousness.

<P>&nbsp;A train of thought thus incited in the Pcs may either disappear
spontaneously, or it may continue. The former eventuality we conceive as
follows: it diffuses its energy through all the association paths emanating
from it, and throws the entire chain of thoughts into a state of excitation,
which continues for a while, and then subsides, through the excitation
which had called for discharge being transformed into dormant cathexis.
If this first eventuality occurs, the process has no further significance
for dream-formation. But other directing ideas are lurking in our preconscious,
which have their source in our unconscious and ever- active wishes. These
may gain control of the excitation in the circle of thoughts thus left
to itself, establish a connection between it and the unconscious wish,
and transfer to it the energy inherent in the unconscious wish. Henceforth
the neglected or suppressed train of thought is in a position to maintain
itself, although this reinforcement gives it no claim to access to consciousness.
We may say, then, that the hitherto preconscious train of thought has been
drawn into the unconscious.

<P>&nbsp;Other constellations leading to dream-formation might be as follows:
The preconscious train of thought might have been connected from the beginning
with the unconscious wish, and for that reason might have met with rejection
by the dominating aim- cathexis. Or an unconscious wish might become active
for other (possibly somatic) reasons, and of its own accord seek a transference
to the psychic residues not cathected by the Pcs. All three cases have
the same result: there is established in the preconscious a train of thought
which, having been abandoned by the preconscious cathexis, has acquired
cathexis from the unconscious wish.

<P>&nbsp;From this point onward the train of thought is subjected to a
series of transformations which we no longer recognize as normal psychic
processes, and which give a result that we find strange, a psychopathological
formation. Let us now emphasize and bring together these transformations:

<P>&nbsp;1. The intensities of the individual ideas become capable of discharge
in their entirety, and pass from one idea to another, so that individual
ideas are formed which are endowed with great intensity. Through the repeated
occurrence of this process, the intensity of an entire train of thought
may ultimately be concentrated in a single conceptual unit. This is the
fact of compression or condensation with which we become acquainted when
investigating the dream-work. It is condensation that is mainly responsible
for the strange impression produced by dreams, for we know of nothing analogous
to it in the normal psychic life that is accessible to consciousness. We
get here, too, ideas which are of great psychic significance as nodal points
or as end-results of whole chains of thought, but this value is not expressed
by any character actually manifest for our internal perception; what is
represented in it is not in any way made more intensive. In the process
of condensation the whole set of psychic connections becomes transformed
into the intensity of the idea-content. The situation is the same as when,
in the case of a book, I italicize or print in heavy type any word to which
I attach outstanding value for the understanding of the text. In speech,
I should pronounce the same word loudly, and deliberately, and with emphasis.
The first simile points immediately to one of the examples which were given
of the dream-work (trimethylamine in the dream of Irma's injection). Historians
of art call our attention to the fact that the most ancient sculptures
known to history follow a similar principle, in expressing the rank of
the persons represented by the size of the statues. The king is made two
or three times as tall as his retinue or his vanquished enemies. But a
work of art of the Roman period makes use of more subtle means to accomplish
the same end. The figure of the Emperor is placed in the centre, erect
and in his full height, and special care is bestowed on the modelling of
this figure; his enemies are seen cowering at his feet; but he is no longer
made to seem a giant among dwarfs. At the same time, in the bowing of the
subordinate to his superior, even in our own day, we have an echo of this
ancient principle of representation.

<P>&nbsp;The direction followed by the condensations of the dream is prescribed
on the one hand by the true preconscious relations of the dream-thoughts,
and, on the other hand, by the attraction of the visual memories in the
unconscious. The success of the condensation-work produces those intensities
which are required for penetration to the perception-system.

<P>&nbsp;2. By the free transference of intensities, and in the service
of the condensation, intermediary ideas- compromises, as it were- are formed
(cf. the numerous examples). This, also, is something unheard of in the
normal movement of our ideas, where what is of most importance is the selection
and the retention of the right conceptual material. On the other hand,
composite and compromise formations occur with extraordinary frequency
when we are trying to find verbal expression for preconscious thoughts;
these are considered slips of the tongue.

<P>&nbsp;3. The ideas which transfer their intensities to one another are
very loosely connected, and are joined together by such forms of association
as are disdained by our serious thinking, and left to be exploited solely
by wit. In particular, assonances and punning associations are treated
as equal in value to any other associations.

<P>&nbsp;4. Contradictory thoughts do not try to eliminate one another,
but continue side by side, and often combine to form condensation- products,
as though no contradiction existed; or they form compromises for which
we should never forgive our thought, but which we frequently sanction in
our action.

<P>&nbsp;These are some of the most conspicuous abnormal processes to which
the dream-thoughts which have previously been rationally formed are subjected
in the course of the dream-work. As the main feature of these processes,
we may see that the greatest importance is attached to rendering the cathecting
energy mobile and capable of discharge; the content and the intrinsic significance
of the psychic elements to which these cathexes adhere become matters of
secondary importance. One might perhaps assume that condensation and compromise-formation
are effected only in the service of regression, when the occasion arises
for changing thoughts into images. But the analysis- and still more plainly
the synthesis- of such dreams as show no regression towards images, e.g.,
the dream Autodidasker: Conversation with Professor N, reveals the same
processes of displacement and condensation as do the rest.

<P>&nbsp;We cannot, therefore, avoid the conclusion that two kinds of essentially
different psychic processes participate in dream- formation; one forms
perfectly correct and fitting dream- thoughts, equivalent to the results
of normal thinking, while the other deals with these thoughts in a most
astonishing and, as it seems, incorrect way. The latter process we have
already set apart in chapter VI as the dream-work proper. What can we say
now as to the derivation of this psychic process?

<P>&nbsp;It would be impossible to answer this question here if we had
not penetrated a considerable way into the psychology of the neuroses,
and especially of hysteria. From this, however, we learn that the same
"incorrect" psychic processes- as well as others not enumerated- control
the production of hysterical symptoms. In hysteria, too, we find at first
a series of perfectly correct and fitting thoughts, equivalent to our conscious
ones, of whose existence in this form we can, however, learn nothing, i.e.,
which we can only subsequently reconstruct. If they have forced their way
anywhere to perception, we discover from the analysis of the symptom formed
that these normal thoughts have been subjected to abnormal treatment, and
that by means of condensation and compromise-formation, through superficial
associations which cover up contradictions, and eventually along the path
of regression, they have been conveyed into the symptom. In view of the
complete identity between the peculiarities of the dream-work and those
of the psychic activity which issues in psychoneurotic symptoms, we shall
feel justified in transferring to the dream the conclusions urged upon
us by hysteria.

<P>&nbsp;From the theory of hysteria we borrow the proposition that such
an abnormal psychic elaboration of a normal train of thought takes place
only when the latter has been used for the transference of an unconscious
wish which dares from the infantile life and is in a state of repression.
Complying with this proposition, we have built up the theory of the dream
on the assumption that the actuating dream-wish invariably originates in
the unconscious; which, as we have ourselves admitted, cannot be universally
demonstrated, even though it cannot be refuted. But in order to enable
us to say just what repression is, after employing this term so freely,
we shall be obliged to make a further addition to our psychological scaffolding.

<P>&nbsp;We had elaborated the fiction of a primitive psychic apparatus,
the work of which is regulated by the effort to avoid accumulation of excitation,
and as far as possible to maintain itself free from excitation. For this
reason it was constructed after the plan of a reflex apparatus; motility,
in the first place as the path to changes within the body, was the channel
of discharge at its disposal. We then discussed the psychic results of
experiences of gratification, and were able at this point to introduce
a second assumption, namely, that the accumulation of excitation- by processes
that do not concern us here- is felt as pain, and sets the apparatus in
operation in order to bring about again a state of gratification, in which
the diminution of excitation is perceived as pleasure. Such a current in
the apparatus, issuing from pain and striving for pleasure, we call a wish.
We have said that nothing but a wish is capable of setting the apparatus
in motion and that the course of any excitation in the apparatus is regulated
automatically by the perception of pleasure and pain. The first occurrence
of wishing may well have taken the form of a hallucinatory cathexis of
the memory of gratification. But this hallucination, unless it could be
maintained to the point of exhaustion, proved incapable of bringing about
a cessation of the need, and consequently of securing the pleasure connected
with gratification.

<P>&nbsp;Thus, there was required a second activity- in our terminology
the activity of a second system- which would not allow the memory- cathexis
to force its way to perception and thence to bind the psychic forces, but
would lead the excitation emanating from the need-stimulus by a detour,
which by means of voluntary motility would ultimately so change the outer
world as to permit the real perception of the gratifying object. Thus far
we have already elaborated the scheme of the psychic apparatus; these two
systems are the germ of what we set up in the fully developed apparatus
as the Ucs and Pcs.

<P>&nbsp;To change the outer world appropriately by means of motility requires
the accumulation of a large total of experiences in the memory-systems,
as well as a manifold consolidation of the relations which are evoked in
this memory-material by various directing ideas. We will now proceed further
with our assumptions. The activity of the second system, groping in many
directions, tentatively sending forth cathexes and retracting them, needs
on the one hand full command over all memory- material, but on the other
hand it would be a superfluous expenditure of energy were it to send along
the individual thought-paths large quantities of cathexis, which would
then flow away to no purpose and thus diminish the quantity needed for
changing the outer world. Out of a regard for purposiveness, therefore,
I postulate that the second system succeeds in maintaining the greater
part of the energic cathexes in a state of rest, and in using only a small
portion for its operations of displacement. The mechanics of these processes
is entirely unknown to me; anyone who seriously wishes to follow up these
ideas must address himself to the physical analogies, and find some way
of getting a picture of the sequence of motions which ensues on the excitation
of the neurones. Here I do no more than hold fast to the idea that the
activity of the first Psi-system aims at the free outflow of the quantities
of excitation, and that the second system, by means of the cathexes emanating
from it, effects an inhibition of this outflow, a transformation into dormant
cathexis, probably with a rise of potential. I therefore assume that the
course taken by any excitation under the control of the second system is
bound to quite different mechanical conditions from those which obtain
under the control of the first system. After the second system has completed
its work of experimental thought, it removes the inhibition and damming
up of the excitations and allows them to flow off into motility.

<P>&nbsp;An interesting train of thought now presents itself if we consider
the relations of this inhibition of discharge by the second system to the
process of regulation by the pain-principle. Let us now seek out the counterpart
of the primary experience of gratification, namely, the objective experience
of fear. Let a perception-stimulus act on the primitive apparatus and be
the source of a pain-excitation. There will then ensue uncoordinated motor
manifestations, which will go on until one of these withdraws the apparatus
from perception, and at the same time from the pain. On the reappearance
of the percept this manifestation will immediately be repeated (perhaps
as a movement of flight), until the percept has again disappeared. But
in this case no tendency will remain to recathect the perception of the
source of pain by hallucination or otherwise. On the contrary, there will
be a tendency in the primary apparatus to turn away again from this painful
memory-image immediately if it is in any way awakened, since the overflow
of its excitation into perception would, of course, evoke (or more precisely,
begin to evoke) pain. This turning away from a recollection, which is merely
a repetition of the former flight from perception, is also facilitated
by the fact that, unlike the perception, the recollection has not enough
quality to arouse consciousness, and thereby to attract fresh cathexis.
This effortless and regular turning away of the psychic process from the
memory of anything that had once been painful gives us the prototype and
the first example of psychic repression. We all know how much of this turning
away from the painful, the tactics of the ostrich, may still be shown as
present even in the normal psychic life of adults.

<P>&nbsp;In obedience to the pain-principle, therefore, the first Psi-
system is quite incapable of introducing anything unpleasant into the thought-nexus.
The system cannot do anything but wish. If this were to remain so, the
activity of thought of the second system, which needs to have at its disposal
all the memories stored up by experience, would be obstructed. But two
paths are now open: either the work of the second system frees itself completely
from the pain-principle, and continues its course, paying no heed to the
pain attached to given memories, or it contrives to cathect the memory
of the pain in such a manner as to preclude the liberation of pain. We
can reject the first possibility, as the pain-principle also proves to
act as a regulator of the cycle of excitation in the second system; we
are therefore thrown back upon the second possibility, namely, that this
system cathects a memory in such a manner as to inhibit any outflow of
excitation from it, and hence, also, the outflow, comparable to a motor-innervation,
needed for the development of pain. And thus, setting out from two different
starting-points, i.e., from regard for the pain-principle, and from the
principle of the least expenditure of innervation, we are led to the hypothesis
that cathexis through the second system is at the same time an inhibition
of the discharge of excitation. Let us, however, keep a close hold on the
fact- for this is the key to the theory of repression- that the second
system can only cathect an idea when it is in a position to inhibit any
pain emanating from this idea. Anything that withdrew itself from this
inhibition would also remain inaccessible for the second system, i.e.,
would immediately be given up by virtue of the pain- principle. The inhibition
of pain, however, need not be complete; it must be permitted to begin,
since this indicates to the second system the nature of the memory, and
possibly its lack of fitness for the purpose sought by the process of thought.

<P>&nbsp;The psychic process which is alone tolerated by the first system
I shall now call the primary process; and that which results under the
inhibiting action of the second system I shall call the secondary process.
I can also show at another point for what purpose the second system is
obliged to correct the primary process. The primary process strives for
discharge of the excitation in order to establish with the quantity of
excitation thus collected an identity of perception; the secondary process
has abandoned this intention, and has adopted instead the aim of an identity
of thought. All thinking is merely a detour from the memory of gratification
(taken as a purposive idea) to the identical cathexis of the same memory,
which is to be reached once more by the path of motor experiences. Thought
must concern itself with the connecting-paths between ideas without allowing
itself to be misled by their intensities. But it is obvious that condensations
of ideas and intermediate or compromise-formations are obstacles to the
attainment of the identity which is aimed at; by substituting one idea
for another they swerve away from the path which would have led onward
from the first idea. Such procedures are, therefore, carefully avoided
in our secondary thinking. It will readily be seen, moreover, that the
pain- principle, although at other times it provides the thought- process
with its most important clues, may also put difficulties in its way in
the pursuit of identity of thought. Hence, the tendency of the thinking
process must always be to free itself more and more from exclusive regulation
by the pain-principle, and to restrict the development of affect through
the work of thought to the very minimum which remains effective as a signal.
This refinement in functioning is to be achieved by a fresh hyper- cathexis,
effected with the help of consciousness. But we are aware that this refinement
is seldom successful, even in normal psychic life, and that our thinking
always remains liable to falsification by the intervention of the pain-principle.

<P>&nbsp;This, however, is not the breach in the functional efficiency
of our psychic apparatus which makes it possible for thoughts representing
the result of the secondary thought-work to fall into the power of the
primary psychic process; by which formula we may now describe the operations
resulting in dreams and the symptoms of hysteria. This inadequacy results
from the converging of two factors in our development, one of which pertains
solely to the psychic apparatus, and has exercised a determining influence
on the relation of the two systems, while the other operates fluctuatingly,
and introduces motive forces of organic origin into the psychic life. Both
originate in the infantile life, and are a precipitate of the alteration
which our psychic and somatic organism has undergone since our infantile
years.

<P>&nbsp;When I termed one of the psychic processes in the psychic apparatus
the primary process, I did so not only in consideration of its status and
function, but was also able to take account of the temporal relationship
actually involved. So far as we know, a psychic apparatus possessing only
the primary process does not exist, and is to that extent a theoretical
fiction but this at least is a fact: that the primary processes are present
in the apparatus from the beginning, while the secondary processes only
take shape gradually during the course of life, inhibiting and overlaying
the primary, whilst gaining complete control over them perhaps only in
the prime of life. Owing to this belated arrival of the secondary processes,
the essence of our being, consisting of unconscious wish-impulses, remains
something which cannot be grasped or inhibited by the preconscious; and
its part is once and for all restricted to indicating the most appropriate
paths for the wish-impulses originating in the unconscious. These unconscious
wishes represent for all subsequent psychic strivings a compulsion to which
they Must submit themselves, although they may perhaps endeavour to divert
them and to guide them to superior aims. In consequence of this retardation,
an extensive region of the memory-material remains in fact inaccessible
to preconscious cathexis.

<P>&nbsp;Now among these wish-impulses originating in the infantile life.
indestructible and incapable of inhibition, there are some the fulfilments
of which have come to be in contradiction with the purposive ideas of our
secondary thinking. The fulfilment of these wishes would no longer produce
an affect of pleasure, but one of pain; and it is just this conversion
of affect that constitutes the essence of what we call repression. In what
manner and by what motive forces such a conversion can take place constitutes
the problem of repression, which we need here only to touch upon in passing.
It will suffice to note the fact that such a conversion of affect occurs
in the course of development (one need only think of the emergence of disgust,
originally absent in infantile life), and that it is connected with the
activity of the secondary system. The memories from which the unconscious
wish evokes a liberation of affect have never been accessible to the Pcs,
and for that reason this liberation cannot be inhibited. It is precisely
on account of this generation of affect that these ideas are not now accessible
even by way of the preconscious thoughts to which they have transferred
the energy of the wishes connected with them. On the contrary, the pain-
principle comes into play, and causes the Pcs to turn away from these transference-thoughts.
These latter are left to themselves, are repressed, and thus, the existence
of a store of infantile memories, withdrawn from the beginning from the
Pcs, becomes the preliminary condition of repression.

<P>&nbsp;In the most favourable case, the generation of pain terminates
so soon as the cathexis is withdrawn from the transference-thoughts in
the Pcs, and this result shows that the intervention of the pain-principle
is appropriate. It is otherwise, however, if the repressed unconscious
wish receives an organic reinforcement which it can put at the service
of its transference-thoughts, and by which it can enable them to attempt
to break through with their excitation, even if the cathexis of the Pcs
has been taken away from them. A defensive struggle then ensues, inasmuch
as the Pcs reinforces the opposite to the repressed thoughts (counter-
cathexis), and the eventual outcome is that the transference- thoughts
(the carriers of the unconscious wish) break through in some form of compromise
through symptom-formation. But from the moment that the repressed thoughts
are powerfully cathected by the unconscious wish-impulse, but forsaken
by the preconscious cathexis, they succumb to the primary psychic process,
and aim only at motor discharge; or, if the way is clear, at hallucinatory
revival of the desired identity of perception. We have already found, empirically,
that the incorrect processes described are enacted only with thoughts which
are in a state of repression. We are now in a position to grasp yet another
part of the total scheme of the facts. These incorrect Processes are the
primary processes of the psychic apparatus; they occur wherever ideas abandoned
by the preconscious cathexis are left to themselves and can become filled
with the uninhibited energy which flows from the unconscious and strives
for discharge. There are further facts which go to show that the processes
described as incorrect are not really falsifications of our normal procedure,
or defective thinking. but the modes of operation of the psychic apparatus
when freed from inhibition. Thus we see that the process of the conveyance
of the preconscious excitation to motility occurs in accordance with the
same procedure, and that in the linkage of preconscious ideas with words
we may easily find manifested the same displacements and confusions (which
we ascribe to inattention). Finally, a proof of the increased work made
necessary by the inhibition of these primary modes of procedure might be
found in the fact that we achieve a comical effect, a surplus to be discharged
through laughter, if we allow these modes of thought to come to consciousness.

<P>&nbsp;The theory of the psychoneuroses asserts with absolute certainty
that it can only be sexual wish-impulses from the infantile life, which
have undergone repression (affect-conversion) during the developmental
period of childhood, which are capable of renewal at later periods of development
(whether as a result of our sexual constitution, which has, of course,
grown out of an original bi-sexuality, or in consequence of unfavourable
influences in our sexual life); and which therefore supply the motive-power
for all psychoneurotic symptom-formation. It is only by the introduction
of these sexual forces that the gaps still demonstrable in the theory of
repression can be filled. Here, I will leave it undecided whether the postulate
of the sexual and infantile holds good for the theory of dreams as well;
I am not completing the latter, because in assuming that the dream-wish
invariably originates in the unconscious I have already gone a step beyond
the demonstrable. * Nor will I inquire further into the nature of the difference
between the play of psychic forces in dream-formation and in the formation
of hysterical symptoms, since there is missing here the needed fuller knowledge
of one of the two things to be compared. But there is another point which
I regard as important, and I will confess at once that it was only on account
of this point that I entered upon all the discussions concerning the two
psychic systems, their modes of operation, and the fact of repression.
It does not greatly matter whether I have conceived the psychological relations
at issue with approximate correctness, or, as is easily possible in such
a difficult matter, wrongly and imperfectly. However our views may change
about the interpretation of the psychic censorship or the correct and the
abnormal elaboration of the dream-content. it remains certain that such
processes are active in dream-formation, and that in their essentials they
reveal the closest analogy with the processes observed in the formation
of hysterical symptoms. Now the dream is not a pathological phenomenon;
it does not presuppose any disturbance of our psychic equilibrium; and
it does not leave behind it any weakening of our efficiency or capacities.
The objection that no conclusions can be drawn about the dreams of healthy
persons from my own dreams and from those of my neurotic patients may be
rejected without comment. If, then, from the nature of the given phenomena
we infer the nature of their motive forces, we find that the psychic mechanism
utilized by the neuroses is not newly-created by a morbid disturbance that
lays hold of the psychic life, but lies in readiness in the normal structure
of our psychic apparatus. The two psychic systems, the frontier-censorship
between them, the inhibition and overlaying of the one activity by the
other, the relations of both to consciousness- or whatever may take place
of these concepts on a juster interpretation of the actual relations- all
these belong to the normal structure of our psychic instrument, and the
dream shows us one of the paths which lead to a knowledge of this structure.
If we wish to be content with a minimum of perfectly assured additions
to our knowledge, we shall say that the dream affords proof that the suppressed
material continues to exist even in the normal person and remains capable
of psychic activity. Dreams are one of the manifestations of this suppressed
material; theoretically, this is true in all cases; and in tangible experience,
it has been found true in at least a great number of cases, which happen
to display most plainly the more striking features of the dream-life. The
suppressed psychic material, which in the waking state has been prevented
from expression and cut off from internal perception by the mutual neutralization
of contradictory attitudes, finds ways and means, under the sway of compromise-formations,
of obtruding itself on consciousness during the night.

<P>Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo. *(2)

<P>At any rate, the interpretation of dreams is the via regia to a knowledge
of the unconscious element in our psychic life.

<P>* Here, as elsewhere, there are gaps in the treatment of the subject,
which I have deliberately left, because to fill them up would, on the one
hand, require excessive labour, and, on the other hand, I should have to
depend on material which is foreign to the dream. Thus, for example, I
have avoided stating whether I give the word suppressed a different meaning
from that of the word repressed. No doubt, however, it will have become
clear that the latter emphasizes more than the former the relation to the
unconscious. I have not gone into the problem, which obviously arises,
of why the dream-thoughts undergo distortion by the censorship even when
they abandon the progressive path to consciousness, and choose the path
of regression. And so with other similar omissions. I have, above all,
sought to give some idea of the problems to which the further dissection
of the dream- work leads, and to indicate the other themes with which these
are connected. It was, however, not always easy to decide just where the
pursuit should be discontinued. That I have not treated exhaustively the
part which the psycho-sexual life plays in the dream, and have avoided
the interpretation of dreams of an obviously sexual content, is due to
a special reason- which may not perhaps be that which the reader would
expect. It is absolutely alien to my views and my neuropathological doctrines
to regard the sexual life as a pudendum with which neither the physician
nor the scientific investigator should concern himself. To me, the moral
indignation which prompted the translator of Artemidorus of Daldis to keep
from the reader's knowledge the chapter on sexual dreams contained in the
Symbolism of Dreams is merely ludicrous. For my own part, what decided
my procedure was solely the knowledge that in the explanation of sexual
dreams I should be bound to get deeply involved in the still unexplained
problems of perversion and bisexuality; it was for this reason that I reserved
this material for treatment elsewhere.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) If I cannot influence the gods, I will stir up Acheron.

<P>By the analysis of dreams we obtain some insight into the composition
of this most marvellous and most mysterious of instruments; it is true
that this only takes us a little way, but it gives us a start which enables
us, setting out from the angle of other (properly pathological) formations,
to penetrate further in our disjoining of the instrument. For disease-
at all events that which is rightly called functional- does not necessarily
presuppose the destruction of this apparatus, or the establishment of new
cleavages in its interior: it can be explained dynamically by the strengthening
and weakening of the components of the play of forces, so many of the activities
of which are covered up in normal functioning. It might be shown elsewhere
how the fact that the apparatus is a combination of two instances also
permits of a refinement of its normal functioning which would have been
impossible to a single system. *

<P>* The dream is not the only phenomenon that permits us to base our psycho-pathology
on psychology. In a short unfinished series of articles in the Monatsschrift
fur Psychiatrie und Neurologie ("uber den psychischen Mechanismus der Vergesslichkeit,"
1898, and "uber Deckerinnerungen," 1899) I attempted to interpret a number
of psychic manifestations from everyday life in support of the same conception.
(These and other articles on "Forgetting," "Lapses of Speech," etc., have
now been published in the Psycho- pathology of Everyday Life.)

F. The Unconscious and Consciousness. Reality.</H3>
If we look more closely, we may observe that the psychological considerations
examined in the foregoing chapter require us to assume, not the existence
of two systems near the motor end of the psychic apparatus, but two kinds
of processes or courses taken by excitation. But this does not disturb
us; for we must always be ready to drop our auxiliary ideas, when we think
we are in a position to replace them by something which comes closer to
the unknown reality. Let us now try to correct certain views which may
have taken a misconceived form as long as we regarded the two systems,
in the crudest and most obvious sense, as two localities within the psychic
apparatus- views which have left a precipitate in the terms repression
and penetration. Thus, when we say that an unconscious thought strives
for translation into the preconscious in order subsequently to penetrate
through to consciousness, we do not mean that a second idea has to be formed,
in a new locality, like a paraphrase, as it were, whilst the original persists
by its side; and similarly, when we speak of penetration into consciousness,
we wish carefully to detach from this notion any idea of a change of locality.
When we say that a preconscious idea is repressed and subsequently absorbed
by the unconscious, we might be tempted by these images, borrowed from
the idea of a struggle for a particular territory, to assume that an arrangement
is really broken up in the one psychic locality and replaced by a new one
in the other locality. For these comparisons we will substitute a description
which would seem to correspond more closely to the real state of affairs;
we will say that an energic cathexis is shifted to or withdrawn from a
certain arrangement, so that the psychic formation falls under the domination
of a given instance or is withdrawn from it. Here again we replace a topographical
mode of representation by a dynamic one; it is not the psychic formation
that appears to us as the mobile element, but its innervation. *

<P>* This conception underwent elaboration and modification when it was
recognized that the essential character of a preconscious idea was its
connection with the residues of verbal ideas. See The Unconscious, p. 428
below.

<P>Nevertheless, I think it expedient and justifiable to continue to use
the illustrative idea of the two systems. We shall avoid any abuse of this
mode of representation if we remember that ideas, thoughts, and psychic
formations in general must not in any case be localized in organic elements
of the nervous system but, so to speak, between them, where resistances
and association-tracks form the correlate corresponding to them. Everything
that can become an object of internal perception is virtual, like the image
in the telescope produced by the crossing of light-rays. But we are justified
in thinking of the systems- which have nothing psychic in themselves, and
which never become accessible to our psychic perception- as something similar
to the lenses of the telescope, which project the image. If we continue
this comparison, we might say that the censorship between the two systems
corresponds to the refraction of rays on passing into a new medium.

<P>&nbsp;Thus far, we have developed our psychology on our own responsibility;
it is now time to turn and look at the doctrines prevailing in modern psychology,
and to examine the relation of these to our theories. The problem of the
unconscious in psychology is, according to the forcible statement of Lipps,
* less a psychological problem than the problem of psychology. As long
as psychology disposed of this problem by the verbal explanation that the
psychic is the conscious, and that unconscious psychic occurrences are
an obvious contradiction, there was no possibility of a physician's observations
of abnormal mental states being turned to any psychological account. The
physician and the philosopher can meet only when both acknowledge that
unconscious psychic processes is the appropriate and justified expression
for all established fact. The physician cannot but reject, with a shrug
of his shoulders, the assertion that consciousness is the indispensable
quality of the psychic; if his respect for the utterances of the philosophers
is still great enough, he may perhaps assume that he and they do not deal
with the same thing and do not pursue the same science. For a single intelligent
observation of the psychic life of a neurotic, a single analysis of a dream,
must force upon him the unshakable conviction that the most complicated
and the most accurate operations of thought, to which the name of psychic
occurrences can surely not be refused, may take place without arousing
consciousness. *(2) The physician, it is true, does not learn of these
unconscious processes until they have produced an effect on consciousness
which admits of communication or observation. But this effect on consciousness
may show a psychic character which differs completely from the unconscious
process, so that internal perception cannot possibly recognize in the first
a substitute for the second. The physician must reserve himself the right
to penetrate, by a Process of deduction, from the effect on consciousness
to the unconscious psychic process; he learns in this way that the effect
on consciousness is only a remote psychic product of the unconscious process,
and that the latter has not become conscious as such, and has, moreover,
existed and operated without in any way betraying itself to consciousness.

at the Third International Psychological Congress at Munich, 1897.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) I am happy to be able to point to an author who has drawn
from the study of dreams the same conclusion as regards the relation between
consciousness and the unconscious.

<P>&nbsp;Du Prel says: "The problem: what is the psyche, manifestly requires
a preliminary examination as to whether consciousness and psyche are identical.
But it is just this preliminary question which is answered in the negative
by the dream, which shows that the concept of the psyche extends beyond
that of consciousness, much as the gravitational force of a star extends
beyond its sphere of luminosity" (Philos. d. Mystik, p. 47).

<P>&nbsp;"It is a truth which cannot be sufficiently emphasized that the
concepts of consciousness and of the psyche are not co-extensive" (p. 306).

<P>A return from the over-estimation of the property of consciousness is
the indispensable preliminary to any genuine insight into the course of
psychic events. As Lipps has said, the unconscious must be accepted as
the general basis of the psychic life. The unconscious is the larger circle
which includes the smaller circle of the conscious; everything conscious
has a preliminary unconscious stage, whereas the unconscious can stop at
this stage, and yet claim to be considered a full psychic function. The
unconscious is the true psychic reality; in its inner nature it is just
as much unknown to us as the reality of the external world, and it is just
as imperfectly communicated to us by the data of consciousness as is the
external world by the reports of our sense-organs.

<P>&nbsp;We get rid of a series of dream-problems which have claimed much
attention from earlier writers on the subject when the old antithesis between
conscious life and dream-life is discarded, and the unconscious psychic
assigned to its proper place. Thus, many of the achievements which are
a matter for wonder in a dream are now no longer to be attributed to dreaming,
but to unconscious thinking, which is active also during the day. If the
dream seems to make play with a symbolical representation of the body,
as Scherner has said, we know that this is the work of certain unconscious
phantasies, which are probably under the sway of sexual impulses and find
expression not only in dreams, but also in hysterical phobias and other
symptoms. If the dream continues and completes mental work begun during
the day, and even brings valuable new ideas to light, we have only to strip
off the dream-disguise from this, as the contribution of the dream-work,
and a mark of the assistance of dark powers in the depths of the psyche
(cf. the devil in Tartini's sonata-dream). The intellectual achievement
as such belongs to the same psychic forces as are responsible for all such
achievements during the day. We are probably much too inclined to over-estimate
the conscious character even of intellectual and artistic production. From
the reports of certain writers who have been highly productive, such as
Goethe and Helmholtz, we learn, rather, that the most essential and original
part of their creations came to them in the form of inspirations, and offered
itself to their awareness in an almost completed state. In other cases,
where there is a concerted effort of all the psychic forces, there is nothing
strange in the fact that conscious activity, too, lends its aid. But it
is the much-abused privilege of conscious activity to hide from us all
other activities wherever it participates.

<P>&nbsp;It hardly seems worth while to take up the historical significance
of dreams as a separate theme. Where, for instance, a leader has been impelled
by a dream to engage in a bold undertaking, the success of which has had
the effect of changing history, a new problem arises only so long as the
dream is regarded as a mysterious power and contrasted with other more
familiar psychic forces. The problem disappears as soon as we regard the
dream as a form of expression for impulses to which a resistance was attached
during the day, whilst at night they were able to draw reinforcement from
deep-lying sources of excitation. * But the great respect with which the
ancient peoples regarded dreams is based on a just piece of psychological
divination. It is a homage paid to the unsubdued and indestructible element
in the human soul, to the demonic power which furnishes the dream- wish,
and which we have found again in our unconscious.

<P>* Cf. (chapter II.), the dream (Sa-Turos) of Alexander the Great at
the siege of Tyre.

<P>It is not without purpose that I use the expression in our unconscious,
for what we so call does not coincide with the unconscious of the philosophers,
nor with the unconscious of Lipps. As they use the term, it merely means
the opposite of the conscious. That there exist not only conscious but
also unconscious psychic processes is the opinion at issue, which is so
hotly contested and so energetically defended. Lipps enunciates the more
comprehensive doctrine that everything psychic exists as unconscious, but
that some of it may exist also as conscious. But it is not to prove this
doctrine that we have adduced the phenomena of dreams and hysterical symptom-formation;
the observation of normal life alone suffices to establish its correctness
beyond a doubt. The novel fact that we have learned from the analysis of
psycho-pathological formations, and indeed from the first member of the
group, from dreams, is that the unconscious- and hence all that is psychic-
occurs as a function of two separate systems, and that as such it occurs
even in normal psychic life. There are consequently two kinds of unconscious,
which have not as yet been distinguished by psychologists. Both are unconscious
in the psychological sense; but in our sense the first, which we call Ucs,
is likewise incapable of consciousness; whereas the second we call Pcs
because its excitations, after the observance of certain rules, are capable
of reaching consciousness; perhaps not before they have again undergone
censorship, but nevertheless regardless of the Ucs system. The fact that
in order to attain consciousness the excitations must pass through an unalterable
series, a succession of instances, as is betrayed by the changes produced
in them by the censorship, has enabled us to describe them by analogy in
spatial terms. We described the relations of the two systems to each other
and to consciousness by saying that the system Pcs is like a screen between
the system Ucs and consciousness. The system Pcs not only bars access to
consciousness, but also controls the access to voluntary motility, and
has control of the emission of a mobile cathectic energy, a portion of
which is familiar to us as attention. *

<P>* Cf. here my remarks in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical
Research, vol. xxvi, in which the descriptive, dynamic and systematic meanings
of the ambiguous word Unconscious are distinguished from one another.

<P>We must also steer clear of the distinction between the super- conscious
and the subconscious, which has found such favour in the more recent literature
on the psychoneuroses, for just such a distinction seems to emphasize the
equivalence of what is psychic and what is conscious.

<P>&nbsp;What role is now left, in our representation of things, to the
phenomenon of consciousness, once so all-powerful and over- shadowing all
else? None other than that of a sense-organ for the perception of psychic
qualities. According to the fundamental idea of our schematic attempt we
can regard conscious perception only as the function proper to a special
system for which the abbreviated designation Cs commends itself. This system
we conceive to be similar in its mechanical characteristics to the perception-system
P, and hence excitable by qualities, and incapable of retaining the trace
of changes: i.e., devoid of memory. The psychic apparatus which, with the
sense-organ of the P-systems, is turned to the outer world, is itself the
outer world for the sense-organ of Cs, whose teleological justification
depends on this relationship. We are here once more confronted with the
principle of the succession of instances which seems to dominate the structure
of the apparatus. The material of excitation flows to the sense-organ Cs
from two sides: first from the P-system, whose excitation, qualitatively
conditioned, probably undergoes a new elaboration until it attains conscious
perception; and, secondly, from the interior of the apparatus itself, whose
quantitative processes are perceived as a qualitative series of pleasures
and pains once they have reached consciousness after undergoing certain
changes.

<P>&nbsp;The philosophers, who became aware that accurate and highly complicated
thought-structures are possible even without the co- operation of consciousness,
thus found it difficult to ascribe any function to consciousness; it appeared
to them a superfluous mirroring of the completed psychic process. The analogy
of our Cs system with the perception-systems relieves us of this embarrassment.
We see that perception through our sense-organs results in directing an
attention-cathexis to the paths along which the incoming sensory excitation
diffuses itself; the qualitative excitation of the P-system serves the
mobile quantity in the psychic apparatus as a regulator of its discharge.
We may claim the same function for the overlying sense-organ of the Cs
system. By perceiving new qualities, it furnishes a new contribution for
the guidance and suitable distribution of the mobile cathexis-quantities.
By means of perceptions of pleasure and pain, it influences the course
of the cathexes within the psychic apparatus, which otherwise operates
unconsciously and by the displacement of quantities. It is probable that
the pain- principle first of all regulates the displacements of cathexis
automatically, but it is quite possible that consciousness contributes
a second and more subtle regulation of these qualities, which may even
oppose the first, and perfect the functional capacity of the apparatus,
by placing it in a position contrary to its original design, subjecting
even that which induces pain to cathexis and to elaboration. We learn from
neuro- psychology that an important part in the functional activity of
the apparatus is ascribed to these regulations by the qualitative excitations
of the sense-organs. The automatic rule of the primary pain-principle,
together with the limitation of functional capacity bound up with it, is
broken by the sensory regulations, which are themselves again automatisms.
We find that repression, which, though originally expedient, nevertheless
finally brings about a harmful lack of inhibition and of psychic control,
overtakes memories much more easily than it does perceptions, because in
the former there is no additional cathexis from the excitation of the psychic
sense-organs. Whilst an idea which is to be warded off may fail to become
conscious because it has succumbed to repression, it may on other occasions
come to be repressed simply because it has been withdrawn from conscious
perception on other grounds. These are clues which we make use of in therapy
in order to undo accomplished repressions.

<P>&nbsp;The value of the hyper-cathexis which is produced by the regulating
influence of the Cs sense-organs on the mobile quantity is demonstrated
in a teleological context by nothing more clearly than by the creation
of a new series of qualities, and consequently a new regulation, which
constitutes the prerogative of man over animals. For the mental processes
are in themselves unqualitative except for the excitations of pleasure
and pain which accompany them: which, as we know, must be kept within limits
as possible disturbers of thought. In order to endow them with quality,
they are associated in man with verbal memories, the qualitative residues
of which suffice to draw upon them the attention of consciousness, which
in turn endows thought with a new mobile cathexis.

<P>&nbsp;It is only on a dissection of hysterical mental processes that
the manifold nature of the problems of consciousness becomes apparent.
One then receives the impression that the transition from the preconscious
to the conscious cathexis is associated with a censorship similar to that
between Ucs and Pcs. This censorship, too, begins to act only when a certain
quantitative limit is reached, so that thought-formations which are not
very intense escape it. All possible cases of detention from consciousness
and of penetration into consciousness under certain restrictions are included
within the range of psychoneurotic phenomena; all point to the intimate
and twofold connection between the censorship and consciousness. I shall
conclude these psychological considerations with the record of two such
occurrences.

<P>&nbsp;On the occasion of a consultation a few years ago, the patient
was an intelligent-looking girl with a simple, unaffected manner. She was
strangely attired; for whereas a woman's dress is usually carefully thought
out to the last pleat, one of her stockings was hanging down and two of
the buttons of her blouse were undone. She complained of pains in one of
her legs, and exposed her calf without being asked to do so. Her chief
complaint, however, was as follows: She had a feeling in her body as though
something were sticking into it which moved to and fro and shook her through
and through. This sometimes seemed to make her whole body stiff. On hearing
this, my colleague in consultation looked at me: the trouble was quite
obvious to him. To both of us it seemed peculiar that this suggested nothing
to the patient's mother, though she herself must repeatedly have been in
the situation described by her child. As for the girl, she had no idea
of the import of her words, or she would never have allowed them to pass
her lips. Here the censorship had been hoodwinked so successfully that
under the mask of an innocent complaint a phantasy was admitted to consciousness
which otherwise would have remained in the preconscious.

<P>&nbsp;Another example: I began the psycho-analytic treatment of a boy
fourteen who was suffering from tic convulsif, hysterical vomiting, headache,
etc., by assuring him that after closing his eyes he would see pictures
or that ideas would occur to him, which he was to communicate to me. He
replied by describing pictures. The last impression he had received before
coming to me was revived visually in his memory. He had been playing a
game of checkers with his uncle, and now he saw the checkerboard before
him. He commented on various positions that were favourable or unfavourable,
on moves that were not safe to make. He then saw a dagger lying on the
checker-board- an object belonging to his father, but which his phantasy
laid on the checker-board. Then a sickle was lying on the board; a scythe
was added; and finally, he saw the image of an old peasant mowing the grass
in front of his father's house far away. A few days later I discovered
the meaning of this series of pictures. Disagreeable family circumstances
had made the boy excited and nervous. Here was a case of a harsh, irascible
father, who had lived unhappily with the boy's mother, and whose educational
methods consisted of threats; he had divorced his gentle and delicate wife,
and remarried; one day he brought home a young woman as the boy's new mother.
The illness of the fourteen-year-old boy developed a few days later. It
was the suppressed rage against his father that had combined these images
into intelligible allusions. The material was furnished by a mythological
reminiscence. The sickle was that with which Zeus castrated his father;
the scythe and the image of the peasant represented Kronos, the violent
old man who devours his children, and upon whom Zeus wreaks his vengeance
in so unfilial a manner. The father's marriage gave the boy an opportunity
of returning the reproaches and threats which the child had once heard
his father utter because he played with his genitals (the draught-board;
the prohibited moves; the dagger with which one could kill). We have here
long-impressed memories and their unconscious derivatives which, under
the guise of meaningless pictures, have slipped into consciousness by the
devious paths opened to them.

<P>&nbsp;If I were asked what is the theoretical value of the study of
dreams, I should reply that it lies in the additions to psychological knowledge
and the beginnings of an understanding of the neuroses which we thereby
obtain. Who can foresee the importance a thorough knowledge of the structure
and functions of the psychic apparatus may attain, when even our present
state of knowledge permits of successful therapeutic intervention in the
curable forms of psychoneuroses? But, it may be asked, what of the practical
value of this study in regard to a knowledge of the psyche and discovery
of the hidden peculiarities of individual character? Have not the unconscious
impulses revealed by dreams the value of real forces in the psychic life?
Is the ethical significance of the suppressed wishes to be lightly disregarded,
since, just as they now create dreams, they may some day create other things?

<P>&nbsp;I do not feel justified in answering these questions. I have not
followed up this aspect of the problem of dreams. In any case, however,
I believe that the Roman Emperor was in the wrong in ordering one of his
subjects to be executed because the latter had dreamt that he had killed
the Emperor. He should first of all have endeavoured to discover the significance
of the man's dreams; most probably it was not what it seemed to be. And
even if a dream of a different content had actually had this treasonable
meaning, it would still have been well to recall the words of Plato- that
the virtuous man contents himself with dreaming of that which the wicked
man does in actual life. I am therefore of the opinion that dreams should
be acquitted of evil. Whether any reality is to be attributed to the unconscious
wishes, I cannot say. Reality must, of course, be denied to all transitory
and intermediate thoughts. If we had before us the unconscious wishes,
brought to their final and truest expression, we should still do well to
remember that psychic reality is a special form of existence which must
not be confounded with material reality. It seems, therefore, unnecessary
that people should refuse to accept the responsibility for the immorality
of their dreams. With an appreciation of the mode of functioning of the
psychic apparatus, and an insight into the relations between conscious
and unconscious, all that is ethically offensive in our dream-life and
the life of phantasy for the most part disappears.

<P>&nbsp;"What a dream has told us of our relations to the present (reality)
we will then seek also in our consciousness and we must not be surprised
if we discover that the monster we saw under the magnifying-glass of the
analysis is a tiny little infusorian" (H. Sachs).

<P>&nbsp;For all practical purposes in judging human character, a man's
actions and conscious expressions of thought are in most cases sufficient.
Actions, above all, deserve to be placed in the front rank; for many impulses
which penetrate into consciousness are neutralized by real forces in the
psychic life before they find issue in action; indeed, the reason why they
frequently do not encounter any psychic obstacle on their path is because
the unconscious is certain of their meeting with resistances later. In
any case, it is highly instructive to learn something of the intensively
tilled soil from which our virtues proudly emerge. For the complexity of
human character, dynamically moved in all directions, very rarely accommodates
itself to the arbitrament of a simple alternative, as our antiquated moral
philosophy would have it.

<P>&nbsp;And what of the value of dreams in regard to our knowledge of
the future? That, of course, is quite out of the question. One would like
to substitute the words: in regard to our knowledge of the past. For in
every sense a dream has its origin in the past. The ancient belief that
dreams reveal the future is not indeed entirely devoid of the truth. By
representing a wish as fulfilled the dream certainly leads us into the
future; but this future, which the dreamer accepts as his present, has
been shaped in the likeness of the past by the indestructible wish.
