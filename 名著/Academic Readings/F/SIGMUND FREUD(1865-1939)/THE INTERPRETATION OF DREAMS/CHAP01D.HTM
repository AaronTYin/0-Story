D. Why Dreams Are Forgotten After Waking</H3>
That a dream fades away in the morning is proverbial. It is, indeed, possible
to recall it. For we know the dream, of course, only by recalling it after
waking; but we very often believe that we remember it incompletely, that
during the night there was more of it than we remember. We may observe
how the memory of a dream which in the morning was still vivid fades in
the course of the day, leaving only a few trifling remnants. We are often
aware that we have been dreaming, but we do not know of what we have dreamed;
and we are so well used to this fact- that the dream is liable to be forgotten-
that we do not reject as absurd the possibility that we may have been dreaming
even when, in the morning, we know nothing either of the content of the
dream or of the fact that we have dreamed. On the other hand, it often
happens that dreams manifest an extraordinary power of maintaining themselves
in the memory. I have had occasion to analyse, with my patients, dreams
which occurred to them twenty-five years or more previously, and I can
remember a dream of my own which is divided from the present day by at
least thirty-seven years, and yet has lost nothing of its freshness in
my memory. All this is very remarkable, and for the present incomprehensible.

<P>The forgetting of dreams is treated in the most detailed manner by Strumpell.
This forgetting is evidently a complex phenomenon; for Strumpell attributes
it not to a single cause, but to quite a number of causes.

<P>In the first place, all those factors which induce forgetfulness in
the waking state determine also the forgetting of dreams. In the waking
state we commonly very soon forget a great many sensations and perceptions
because they are too slight to remember, and because they are charged with
only a slight amount of emotional feeling. This is true also of many dream-images;
they are forgotten because they are too weak, while the stronger images
in their neighbourhood are remembered. However, the factor of intensity
is in itself not the only determinant of the preservation of dream-images;
Strumpell, as well as other authors (Calkins), admits that dream-images
are often rapidly forgotten although they are known to have been vivid,
whereas, among those that are retained in the memory, there are many that
are very shadowy and unmeaning. Besides, in the waking state one is wont
to forget rather easily things that have happened only once, and to remember
more readily things which occur repeatedly. But most dream-images are unique
experiences, * and this peculiarity would contribute towards the forgetting
of all dreams equally. Of much greater significance is a third cause of
forgetting. In order that feelings, representations, ideas and the like
should attain a certain degree of memorability, it is important that they
should not remain isolated, but that they should enter into connections
and associations of an appropriate nature. If the words of a verse of poetry
are taken and mixed together, it will be very difficult to remember them.
"Properly placed, in a significant sequence, one word helps another, and
the whole, making sense, remains and is easily and lastingly fixed in the
memory. Contradictions, as a rule, are retained with just as much difficulty
and just as rarely as things that are confused and disorderly." Now dreams,
in most cases, lack sense and order. Dream-compositions, by their very
nature, are insusceptible of being remembered, and they are forgotten because
as a rule they fall to pieces the very next moment. To be sure, these conclusions
are not entirely consistent with Radestock's observation (p. 168), that
we most readily retain just those dreams which are most peculiar.

<P>* Periodically recurrent dreams have been observed repeatedly. Compare
the collection made by Chabaneix.

<P>According to Strumpell, other factors, deriving from the relation of
the dream to the waking state, are even more effective in causing us to
forget our dreams. The forgetfulness of dreams manifested by the waking
consciousness is evidently merely the counterpart of the fact already mentioned,
namely, that the dream hardly ever takes over an orderly series of memories
from the waking state, but only certain details of these memories, which
it removes from the habitual psychic connections in which they are remembered
in the waking state. The dream-composition, therefore, has no place in
the community of the psychic series which fill the mind. It lacks all mnemonic
aids. "In this manner the dream-structure rises, as it were, from the soil
of our psychic life, and floats in psychic space like a cloud in the sky,
quickly dispelled by the first breath of reawakening life" (p. 87). This
situation is accentuated by the fact that on waking the attention is immediately
besieged by the inrushing world of sensation, so that very few dream-images
are capable of withstanding its force. They fade away before the impressions
of the new day like the stars before the light of the sun.

<P>Finally, we should remember that the fact that most people take but
little interest in their dreams is conducive to the forgetting of dreams.
Anyone who for some time applies himself to the investigation of dreams,
and takes a special interest in them, usually dreams more during that period
than at any other; he remembers his dreams more easily and more frequently.

<P>Two other reasons for the forgetting of dreams, which Bonatelli (cited
by Benini) adds to those adduced by Strumpell, have already been included
in those enumerated above; namely, (1) that the difference of the general
sensation in the sleeping and the waking state is unfavourable to mutual
reproduction, and (2) that the different arrangement of the material in
the dream makes the dream untranslatable, so to speak, for the waking consciousness.

<P>It is therefore all the more remarkable, as Strumpell himself observes,
that, in spite of all these reasons for forgetting the dream, so many dreams
are retained in the memory. The continual efforts of those who have written
on the subject to formulate laws for the remembering of dreams amount to
an admission that here, too, there is something puzzling and unexplained.
Certain peculiarities relating to the remembering of dreams have attracted
particular attention of late; for example, the fact that the dream which
is believed to be forgotten in the morning may be recalled in the course
of the day on the occasion of some perception which accidentally touches
the forgotten content of the dream (Radestock, Tissie). But the whole recollection
of dreams is open to an objection which is calculated greatly to depreciate
its value in critical eyes. One may doubt whether our memory, which omits
so much from the dream, does not falsify what it retains.

<P>This doubt as to the exactness of the reproduction of dreams is expressed
by Strumpell when he says: "It may therefore easily happen that the waking
consciousness involuntarily interpolates a great many things in the recollection
of the dream; one imagines that one has dreamt all sorts of things which
the actual dream did not contain."

<P>Jessen (p. 547) expresses himself in very decided terms:

<P>"Moreover, we must not lose sight of the fact, hitherto little heeded,
that in the investigation and interpretation of coherent and logical dreams
we almost always take liberties with the truth when we recall a dream to
memory. Unconsciously and unintentionally we fill up the gaps and supplement
the dream-images. Rarely, and perhaps never, has a connected dream been
as connected as it appears to us in memory. Even the most truth-loving
person can hardly relate a dream without exaggerating and embellishing
it in some degree. The human mind so greatly tends to perceive everything
in a connected form that it intentionally supplies the missing links in
any dream which is in some degree incoherent."

<P>The observations of V. Eggers, though of course independently conceived,
read almost like a translation of Jessen's words:

<P>"...L'observation des reves a ses difficultes speciales et le seul moyen
d'eviter toute erreur en pareille matiere est de confier au papier sans
le moindre retard ce que l'on vient d'eprouver et de remarquer; sinon,
l'oubli vient vite ou total ou partiel; l'oubli total est sans gravite;
mais l'oubli partiel est perfide: car si l'on se met ensuite a raconter
ce que l'on n'a pas oublie, on est expose a completer par imagination les
fragments incoherents et disjoints fourni par la memoire... on devient
artiste a son insu, et le recit, periodiquement repete s'impose a la creance
de son auteur, qui, de bonne foi, le presente comme un fait authentique,
dument etabli selon les bonnes methodes...." *

<P>* ...The observation of dreams has its special difficulties, and the
only way to avoid all error in such matter is to put on paper without the
least delay what has just been experienced and noticed; otherwise, totally
or partially the dream is quickly forgotten; total forgetting is without
seriousness; but partial forgetting is treacherous: for, if one then starts
to recount what has not been forgotten, one is likely to supplement from
the imagination the incoherent and disjointed fragments provided by the
memory.... unconsciously one becomes an artist, and the story, repeated
from time to time, imposes itself on the belief of its author, who, in
good faith, tells it as authentic fact, regularly established according
to proper methods....

<P>Similarly Spitta, who seems to think that it is only in the attempt
to reproduce the dream that we bring order and arrangement into loosely
associated dream-elements- "turning juxtaposition into concatenation; that
is, adding the process of logical connection which is absent in the dream."

<P>Since we can test the reliability of our memory only by objective means,
and since such a test is impossible in the case of dreams, which are our
own personal experience, and for which we know no other source than our
memory, what value do our recollections of our dreams possess?
