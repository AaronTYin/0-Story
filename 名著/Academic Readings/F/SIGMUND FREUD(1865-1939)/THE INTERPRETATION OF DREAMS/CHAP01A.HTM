CHAPTER ONE:<BR>
THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE OF DREAM-PROBLEMS&nbsp;<BR>
(UP TO 1900)</H2></CENTER>
In the following pages I shall demonstrate that there is a psychological
technique which makes it possible to interpret dreams, and that on the
application of this technique every dream will reveal itself as a psychological
structure, full of significance, and one which may be assigned to a specific
place in the psychic activities of the waking state. Further, I shall endeavour
to elucidate the processes which underlie the strangeness and obscurity
of dreams, and to deduce from these processes the nature of the psychic
forces whose conflict or cooperation is responsible for our dreams. This
done, my investigation will terminate, as it will have reached the point
where the problem of the dream merges into more comprehensive problems,
and to solve these we must have recourse to material of a different kind.

<P>I shall begin by giving a short account of the views of earlier writers
on this subject, and of the status of the dream-problem in contemporary
science; since in the course of this treatise I shall not often have occasion
to refer to either. In spite of thousands of years of endeavour, little
progress has been made in the scientific understanding of dreams. This
fact has been so universally acknowledged by previous writers on the subject
that it seems hardly necessary to quote individual opinions. The reader
will find, in the works listed at the end of this work, many stimulating
observations, and plenty of interesting material relating to our subject,
but little or nothing that concerns the true nature of the dream, or that
solves definitely any of its enigmas. The educated layman, of course, knows
even less of the matter.

<P>The conception of the dream that was held in prehistoric ages by primitive
peoples, and the influence which it may have exerted on the formation of
their conceptions of the universe, and of the soul, is a theme of such
great interest that it is only with reluctance that I refrain from dealing
with it in these pages. I will refer the reader to the well-known works
of Sir John Lubbock (Lord Avebury), Herbert Spencer, E. B. Tylor, and other
writers; I will only add that we shall not realize the importance of these
problems and speculations until we have completed the task of dream- interpretation
that lies before us.

<P>A reminiscence of the concept of the dream that was held in primitive
times seems to underlie the evaluation of the dream which was current among
the peoples of classical antiquity. * They took it for granted that dreams
were related to the world of the supernatural beings in whom they believed,
and that they brought inspirations from the gods and demons. Moreover,
it appeared to them that dreams must serve a special purpose in respect
of the dreamer; that, as a rule, they predicted the future. The extraordinary
variations in the content of dreams, and in the impressions which they
produced on the dreamer, made it, of course, very difficult to formulate
a coherent conception of them, and necessitated manifold differentiations
and group-formations, according to their value and reliability. The valuation
of dreams by the individual philosophers of antiquity naturally depended
on the importance which they were prepared to attribute to manticism in
general.

<P>* The following remarks are based on Buchsenschutz's careful essay,
Traum und Traumdeutung im Altertum (Berlin 1868).

<P>In the two works of Aristotle in which there is mention of dreams, they
are already regarded as constituting a problem of psychology. We are told
that the dream is not god-sent, that it is not of divine but of demonic
origin. For nature is really demonic, not divine; that is to say, the dream
is not a supernatural revelation, but is subject to the laws of the human
spirit, which has, of course, a kinship with the divine. The dream is defined
as the psychic activity of the sleeper, inasmuch as he is asleep. Aristotle
was acquainted with some of the characteristics of the dream-life; for
example, he knew that a dream converts the slight sensations perceived
in sleep into intense sensations ("one imagines that one is walking through
fire, and feels hot, if this or that part of the body becomes only quite
slightly warm"), which led him to conclude that dreams might easily betray
to the physician the first indications of an incipient physical change
which escaped observation during the day. *

<P>* The relationship between dreams and disease is discussed by Hippocrates
in a chapter of his famous work.

<P>As has been said, those writers of antiquity who preceded Aristotle
did not regard the dream as a product of the dreaming psyche, but as an
inspiration of divine origin, and in ancient times the two opposing tendencies
which we shall find throughout the ages in respect of the evaluation of
the dream- life were already perceptible. The ancients distinguished between
the true and valuable dreams which were sent to the dreamer as warnings,
or to foretell future events, and the vain, fraudulent, and empty dreams
whose object was to misguide him or lead him to destruction.

<P>Gruppe * speaks of such a classification of dreams, citing Macrobius
and Artemidorus: "Dreams were divided into two classes; the first class
was believed to be influenced only by the present (or the past), and was
unimportant in respect of the future; it included the enuknia (insomnia),
which directly reproduce a given idea or its opposite; e.g., hunger or
its satiation; and the phantasmata, which elaborate the given idea phantastically,
as e.g. the nightmare, ephialtes. The second class of dreams, on the other
hand, was determinative of the future. To this belonged:

<P>1. Direct prophecies received in the dream (chrematismos, oraculum);

<P>2. the foretelling of a future event (orama, visio);

<P>3. the symbolic dream, which requires interpretation (oneiros, somnium.)

<P>This theory survived for many centuries."

<P>* Griechische Mythologie und Religionsgeschichte, p. 390.

<P>Connected with these varying estimations of the dream was the problem
of "dream-interpretation." Dreams in general were expected to yield important
solutions, but not every dream was immediately understood, and it was impossible
to be sure that a certain incomprehensible dream did not really foretell
something of importance, so that an effort was made to replace the incomprehensible
content of the dream by something that should be at once comprehensible
and significant. In later antiquity Artemidorus of Daldis was regarded
as the greatest authority on dream-interpretation. His comprehensive works
must serve to compensate us for the lost works of a similar nature. * The
pre-scientific conception of the dream which obtained among the ancients
was, of course, in perfect keeping with their general conception of the
universe, which was accustomed to project as an external reality that which
possessed reality only in the life of the psyche. Further, it accounted
for the main impression made upon the waking life by the morning memory
of the dream; for in this memory the dream, as compared with the rest of
the psychic content, seems to be something alien, coming, as it were, from
another world. It would be an error to suppose that theory of the supernatural
origin of dreams lacks followers even in our own times; for quite apart
from pietistic and mystical writers- who cling, as they are perfectly justified
in doing, to the remnants of the once predominant realm of the supernatural
until these remnants have been swept away by scientific explanation- we
not infrequently find that quite intelligent persons, who in other respects
are averse from anything of a romantic nature, go so far as to base their
religious belief in the existence and co-operation of superhuman spiritual
powers on the inexplicable nature of the phenomena of dreams (Haffner).
The validity ascribed to the dream-life by certain schools of philosophy-
for example, by the school of Schelling- is a distinct reminiscence of
the undisputed belief in the divinity of dreams which prevailed in antiquity;
and for some thinkers the mantic or prophetic power of dreams is still
a subject of debate. This is due to the fact that the explanations attempted
by psychology are too inadequate to cope with the accumulated material,
however strongly the scientific thinker may feel that such superstitious
doctrines should be repudiated.

<P>* For the later history of dream-interpretation in the Middle Ages consult
Diepgen, and the special investigations of M. Forster, Gotthard, and others.
The interpretation of dreams among the Jews has been studied by Amoli,
Amram, and Lowinger, and recently, with reference to the psycho- analytic
standpoint, by Lauer. Details of the Arabic methods of dream- interpretation
are furnished by Drexl, F. Schwarz, and the missionary Tfinkdji. The interpretation
of dreams among the Japanese has been investigated by Miura and Iwaya,
among the Chinese by Secker, and among the Indians by Negelein.

<P>To write strongly the history of our scientific knowledge of the dream-
problem is extremely difficult, because, valuable though this knowledge
may be in certain respects, no real progress in a definite direction is
as yet discernible. No real foundation of verified results has hitherto
been established on which future investigators might continue to build.
Every new author approaches the same problems afresh, and from the very
beginning. If I were to enumerate such authors in chronological order,
giving a survey of the opinions which each has held concerning the problems
of the dream, I should be quite unable to draw a clear and complete picture
of the present state of our knowledge on the subject. I have therefore
preferred to base my method of treatment on themes rather than on authors,
and in attempting the solution of each problem of the dream I shall cite
the material found in the literature of the subject.

<P>But as I have not succeeded in mastering the whole of this literature-
for it is widely dispersed, and interwoven with the literature of other
subjects- I must ask my readers to rest content with my survey as it stands,
provided that no fundamental fact or important point of view has been overlooked.

<P>Until recently most authors have been inclined to deal with the subjects
of sleep and dreams in conjunction, and together with these they have commonly
dealt with analogous conditions of a psycho-pathological nature, and other
dream-like phenomena, such as hallucinations, visions, etc. In recent works,
on the other hand, there has been a tendency to keep more closely to the
theme, and to consider, as a special subject, the separate problems of
the dream-life. In this change I should like to perceive an expression
of the growing conviction that enlightenment and agreement in such obscure
matters may be attained only by a series of detailed investigations. Such
a detailed investigation, and one of a special psychological nature, is
expounded in these pages. I have had little occasion to concern myself
with the problem of sleep, as this is essentially a physiological problem,
although the changes in the functional determination of the psychic apparatus
should be included in a description of the sleeping state. The literature
of sleep will therefore not be considered here.

<P>A scientific interest in the phenomena of dreams as such leads us to
propound the following problems, which to a certain extent, interdependent,
merge into one another.
<H3>
A. The Relation of the Dream to the Waking State</H3>
The naive judgment of the dreamer on waking assumes that the dream- even
if it does not come from another world- has at all events transported the
dreamer into another world. The old physiologist, Burdach, to whom we are
indebted for a careful and discriminating description of the phenomena
of dreams, expressed this conviction in a frequently quoted passage (p.
474): "The waking life, with its trials and joys, its pleasures and pains,
is never repeated; on the contrary, the dream aims at relieving us of these.
Even when our whole mind is filled with one subject, when our hearts are
rent by bitter grief, or when some task has been taxing our mental capacity
to the utmost, the dream either gives us something entirely alien, or it
selects for its combinations only a few elements of reality; or it merely
enters into the key of our mood, and symbolizes reality." J. H. Fichte
(I. 541) speaks in precisely the same sense of supplementary dreams, calling
them one of the secret, self-healing benefits of the psyche. L. Strumpell
expresses himself to the same effect in his Natur und Entstehung der Traume,
a study which is deservedly held in high esteem. "He who dreams turns his
back upon the world of waking consciousness" (p. 16); "In the dream the
memory of the orderly content of waking consciousness and its normal behaviour
is almost entirely lost" (p. 17); "The almost complete and unencumbered
isolation of the psyche in the dream from the regular normal content and
course of the waking state..." (p. 19).

<P>Yet the overwhelming majority of writers on the subject have adopted
the contrary view of the relation of the dream to waking life. Thus Haffner
(p. 19): "To begin with, the dream continues the waking life. Our dreams
always connect themselves with such ideas as have shortly before been present
in our consciousness. Careful examination will nearly always detect a thread
by which the dream has linked itself to the experiences of the previous
day." Weygandt (p. 6) flatly contradicts the statement of Burdach. "For
it may often be observed, apparently indeed in the great majority of dreams,
that they lead us directly back into everyday life, instead of releasing
us from it." Maury (p. 56) expresses the same idea in a concise formula:
"Nous revons de ce que nous avons vu, dit, desire, ou fait." * Jessen,
in his Psychologie, published in 1855 (p. 530), is rather more explicit:
"The content of dreams is always more or less determined by the personality,
the age, sex, station in life, education and habits, and by the events
and experiences of the whole past life of the individual."

<P>* We dream of what we have seen, said, desired, or done.

<P>The philosopher, I. G. E. Maas, adopts the most unequivocal attitude
in respect of this question (Uber die Leidenschaften, 1805): "Experience
corroborates our assertion that we dream most frequently of those things
toward which our warmest passions are directed. This shows us that our
passions must influence the generation of our dreams. The ambitious man
dreams of the laurels which he has won (perhaps only in imagination), or
has still to win, while the lover occupies himself, in his dreams, with
the object of his dearest hopes.... All the sensual desires and loathings
which slumber in the heart, if they are stimulated by any cause, may combine
with other ideas and give rise to a dream; or these ideas may mingle in
an already existing dream." *

<P>* Communicated by Winterstein to the Zentralblatt fur Psychoanalyse.

<P>The ancients entertained the same idea concerning the dependence of
the dream-content on life. I will quote Radestock (p. 139): "When Xerxes,
before his expedition against Greece, was dissuaded from his resolution
by good counsel, but was again and again incited by dreams to undertake
it, one of the old, rational dream-interpreters of the Persians, Artabanus,
told him, and very appropriately, that dream-images for the most part contain
that of which one has been thinking in the waking state."

<P>In the didactic poem of Lucretius, On the Nature of Things (IV. 962),
there occurs this passage:

<P>"Et quo quisque fere studio devinctus adhaeret, aut quibus in rebus
multum sumus ante morati atque in ea ratione fuit contenta magis mens,
in somnis eadem plerumque videmur obire; causidici causas agere et componere
leges, induperatores pugnare ac proelia obire,"... etc., etc. * Cicero
(De Divinatione, II. LXVII) says, in a similar strain, as does also Maury
many centuries later: "Maximeque 'reliquiae' rerum earum moventur in animis
et agitantur, de quibus vigilantes aut cogitavimus aut egimus." *(2)

<P>* And whatever be the pursuit to which one clings with devotion, whatever
the things on which we have been occupied much in the past, the mind being
thus more intent upon that pursuit, it is generally the same things that
we seem to encounter in dreams; pleaders to plead their cause and collate
laws, generals to contend and engage battle.

<P>*(2) And especially the "remnant" of our waking thoughts and deeds move
and stir within the soul.

<P>The contradiction between these two views concerning the relation between
dream life and waking life seems indeed irresolvable. Here we may usefully
cite the opinion of F. W. Hildebrandt (1875), who held that on the whole
the peculiarities of the dream can only be described as "a series of contrasts
which apparently amount to contradictions" (p. 8). "The first of these
contrasts is formed by the strict isolation or seclusion of the dream from
true and actual life on the one hand, and on the other hand by the continuous
encroachment of the one upon the other, and the constant dependence of
the one upon the other. The dream is something absolutely divorced from
the reality experienced during the waking state; one may call it an existence
hermetically sealed up and insulated from real life by an unbridgeable
chasm. It frees us from reality, blots out the normal recollection of reality,
and sets us in another world and a totally different life, which fundamentally
has nothing in common with real life...." Hildebrandt then asserts that
in falling asleep our whole being, with its forms of existence, disappears
"as through an invisible trapdoor." In one's dream one is perhaps making
a voyage to St. Helena in order to offer the imprisoned Napoleon an exquisite
vintage of Moselle. One is most affably received by the ex-emperor, and
one feels almost sorry when, on waking, the interesting illusion is destroyed.
But let us now compare the situation existing in the dream with the actual
reality. The dreamer has never been a wine-merchant, and has no desire
to become one. He has never made a sea-voyage, and St. Helena is the last
place in the world that he would choose as the destination of such a voyage.
The dreamer feels no sympathy for Napoleon, but on the contrary a strong
patriotic aversion. And lastly, the dreamer was not yet among the living
when Napoleon died on the island of St. Helena; so that it was beyond the
realms of possibility that he should have had any personal relations with
Napoleon. The dream- experience thus appears as something entirely foreign,
interpolated between two mutually related and successive periods of time.

<P>"Nevertheless," continues Hildebrandt, "the apparent contrary is just
as true and correct. I believe that side by side with this seclusion and
insulation there may still exist the most intimate interrelation. We may
therefore justly say: Whatever the dream may offer us, it derives its material
from reality, and from the psychic life centered upon this reality. However
extraordinary the dream may seem, it can never detach itself from the real
world, and its most sublime as well as its most ridiculous constructions
must always borrow their elementary material either from that which our
eyes have beheld in the outer world, or from that which has already found
a place somewhere in our waking thoughts; in other words, it must be taken
from that which we have already experienced, either objectively or subjectively."
<H3>
B. The Material of Dreams- Memory in Dreams</H3>
That all the material composing the content of a dream is somehow derived
from experience, that it is reproduced or remembered in the dream- this
at least may be accepted as an incontestable fact. Yet it would be wrong
to assume that such a connection between the dream-content and reality
will be easily obvious from a comparison between the two. On the contrary,
the connection must be carefully sought, and in quite a number of cases
it may for a long while elude discovery. The reason for this is to be found
in a number of peculiarities evinced by the faculty of memory in dreams;
which peculiarities, though generally observed, have hitherto defied explanation.
It will be worth our while to examine these characteristics exhaustively.

<P>To begin with, it happens that certain material appears in the dream-
content which cannot be subsequently recognized, in the waking state, as
being part of one's knowledge and experience. One remembers clearly enough
having dreamed of the thing in question, but one cannot recall the actual
experience or the time of its occurrence. The dreamer is therefore in the
dark as to the source which the dream has tapped, and is even tempted to
believe in an independent productive activity on the part of the dream,
until, often long afterwards, a fresh episode restores the memory of that
former experience, which had been given up for lost, and so reveals the
source of the dream. One is therefore forced to admit that in the dream
something was known and remembered that cannot be remembered in the waking
state. *

<P>* Vaschide even maintains that it has often been observed that in one's
dreams one speaks foreign languages more fluently and with greater purity
than in the waking state.

<P>Delboeuf relates from his own experience an especially impressive example
of this kind. He saw in his dream the courtyard of his house covered with
snow, and found there two little lizards, half-frozen and buried in the
snow. Being a lover of animals he picked them up, warmed them, and put
them back into the hole in the wall which was reserved especially for them.
He also gave them a few fronds of a little fern which was growing on the
wall, and of which he knew they were very fond. In the dream he knew the
name of the plant; Asplenium ruta muralis. The dream continued returning
after a digression to the lizards, and to his astonishment Delboeuf saw
two other little lizards falling upon what was left of the ferns. On turning
his eyes to the open fields he saw a fifth and a sixth lizard making for
the hole in the wall, and finally the whole road was covered by a procession
of lizards, all wandering in the same direction.

<P>In his waking state Delboeuf knew only a few Latin names of plants,
and nothing of any Asplenium. To his great surprise he discovered that
a fern of this name did actually exist, and that the correct name was Asplenium
ruta muraria, which the dream had slightly distorted. An accidental coincidence
was of course inconceivable; yet where he got his knowledge of the name
Asplenium in the dream remained a mystery to him.

<P>The dream occurred in 1862. Sixteen years later, while at the house
of one of his friends, the philosopher noticed a small album containing
dried plants, such as are sold as souvenirs to visitors in many parts of
Switzerland. A sudden recollection came to him: he opened the herbarium,
discovered therein the Asplenium of his dream, and recognized his own handwriting
in the accompanying Latin name. The connection could now be traced. In
1860, two years before the date of the lizard dream, one of his friend's
sisters, while on her wedding-journey, had paid a visit to Delboeuf. She
had with her at the time this very album, which was intended for her brother,
and Delboeuf had taken the trouble to write, at the dictation of a botanist,
the Latin name under each of the dried plants.

<P>The same good fortune which gave this example its unusual value enabled
Delboeuf to trace yet another portion of this dream to its forgotten source.
One day in 1877 he came upon an old volume of an illustrated periodical,
in which he found the whole procession of lizards pictured, just as he
had dreamt of it in 1862. The volume bore the date 1861, and Delboeuf remembered
that he had subscribed to the journal since its first appearance.

<P>That dreams have at their disposal recollections which are inaccessible
to the waking state is such a remarkable and theoretically important fact
that I should like to draw attention to the point by recording yet other
hypermnesic dreams. Maury relates that for some time the word Mussidan
used to occur to him during the day. He knew it to be the name of a French
city, but that was all. One night he dreamed of a conversation with a certain
person, who told him that she came from Mussidan, and, in answer to his
question as to where the city was, she replied: "Mussidan is the principal
town of a district in the department of Dordogne." On waking, Maury gave
no credence to the information received in his dream; but the gazetteer
showed it to be perfectly correct. In this case the superior knowledge
of the dreamer was confirmed, but it was not possible to trace the forgotten
source of this knowledge.

<P>Jessen (p. 55) refers to a very similar incident, the period of which
is more remote. "Among others we may here mention the dream of the elder
Scaliger (Hennings, l.c., p. 300), who wrote a poem in praise of the famous
men of Verona, and to whom a man named Brugnolus appeared in a dream, complaining
that he had been neglected. Though Scaliger could not remember that he
had heard of the man, he wrote some verses in his honour, and his son learned
subsequently that a certain Brugnolus had at one time been famed in Verona
as a critic."

<P>A hypermnesic dream, especially remarkable for the fact that a memory
not at first recalled was afterwards recognized in a dream which followed
the first, is narrated by the Marquis d'Hervey de St. Denis: * "I once
dreamed of a young woman with fair golden hair, whom I saw chatting with
my sister as she showed her a piece of embroidery. In my dream she seemed
familiar to me; I thought, indeed, that I had seen her repeatedly. After
waking, her face was still quite vividly before me, but I was absolutely
unable to recognize it. I fell asleep again; the dream-picture repeated
itself. In this new dream I addressed the golden-haired lady and asked
her whether I had not had the pleasure of meeting her somewhere. 'Of course,'
she replied; 'don't you remember the bathing-place at Pornic?' Thereupon
I awoke, and I was then able to recall with certainty and in detail the
incidents with which this charming dream-face was connected."

<P>* See Vaschide, p. 232.

<P>The same author * recorded that a musician of his acquaintance once
heard in a dream a melody which was absolutely new to him. Not until many
years later did he find it in an old collection of musical compositions,
though still he could not remember ever having seen it before.

<P>* Vaschide, p. 233

<P>I believe that Myers has published a whole collection of such hypermnesic
dreams in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, but these,
unfortunately, are inaccessible to me. I think everyone who occupies himself
with dreams will recognize, as a very common phenomenon, the fact that
a dream will give proof of the knowledge and recollection of matters of
which the dreamer, in his waking state, did not imagine himself to be cognizant.
In my analytic investigations of nervous patients, of which I shall speak
later, I find that it happens many times every week that I am able to convince
them, from their dreams, that they are perfectly well acquainted with quotations,
obscene expressions, etc., and make use of them in their dreams, although
they have forgotten them in their waking state. I shall here cite an innocent
example of dream-hypermnesia, because it was easy to trace the source of
the knowledge which was accessible only in the dream.

<P>A patient dreamed amongst other things (in a rather long dream) that
he ordered a kontuszowka in a cafe, and after telling me this he asked
me what it could be, as he had never heard the name before. I was able
to tell him that kontuszowka was a Polish liqueur, which he could not have
invented in his dream, as the name had long been familiar to me from the
advertisements. At first the patient would not believe me, but some days
later, after he had allowed his dream of the cafe to become a reality,
he noticed the name on a signboard at a street corner which for some months
he had been passing at least twice a day.

<P>I have learned from my own dreams how largely the discovery of the origin
of individual dream-elements may be dependent on chance. Thus, for some
years before I had thought of writing this book, I was haunted by the picture
of a church tower of fairly simple construction, which I could not remember
ever having seen. I then suddenly recognized it, with absolute certainty,
at a small station between Salzburg and Reichenhall. This was in the late
nineties, and the first time I had travelled over this route was in 1886.
In later years, when I was already busily engaged in the study of dreams,
I was quite annoyed by the frequent recurrence of the dream-image of a
certain peculiar locality. I saw, in definite orientation to my own person-
on my left- a dark space in which a number of grotesque sandstone figures
stood out. A glimmering recollection, which I did not quite believe, told
me that it was the entrance to a beer-cellar; but I could explain neither
the meaning nor the origin of this dream-picture. In 1907 I happened to
go to Padua, which, to my regret, I had been unable to visit since 1895.
My first visit to this beautiful university city had been unsatisfactory.
I had been unable to see Giotto's frescoes in the church of the Madonna
dell' Arena: I set out for the church, but turned back on being informed
that it was closed for the day. On my second visit, twelve years later,
I thought I would compensate myself for this disappointment, and before
doing anything else I set out for Madonna dell' Arena. In the street leading
to it, on my left, probably at the spot where I had turned back in 1895,
I discovered the place, with its sandstone figures, which I had so often
seen in my dream. It was, in fact, the entrance to a restaurant garden.

<P>One of the sources from which dreams draw material for reproduction-
material of which some part is not recalled or utilized in our waking thoughts-
is to be found in childhood. Here I will cite only a few of the authors
who have observed and emphasized this fact:

<P>Hildebrandt (p. 23): "It has already been expressly admitted that a
dream sometimes brings back to the mind, with a wonderful power of reproduction,
remote and even forgotten experiences from the earliest periods of one's
life."

<P>Strumpell (p. 40): "The subject becomes more interesting still when
we remember how the dream sometimes drags out, as it were, from the deepest
and densest psychic deposits which later years have piled upon the earliest
experiences of childhood, the pictures of certain persons, places and things,
quite intact, and in all their original freshness. This is confined not
merely to such impressions as were vividly perceived at the time of their
occurrence, or were associated with intense psychological values, to recur
later in the dream as actual reminiscences which give pleasure to the waking
mind. On the contrary, the depths of the dream-memory rather contain such
images of persons, places, things and early experiences as either possessed
but little consciousness and no psychic value whatsoever, or have long
since lost both, and therefore appear totally strange and unknown, both
in the dream and in the waking state, until their early origin is revealed."

<P>Volkelt (p. 119): "It is especially to be remarked how readily infantile
and youthful reminiscences enter into our dreams. What we have long ceased
to think about, what has long since lost all importance for us, is constantly
recalled by the dream."

<P>The control which the dream exercises over material from our childhood,
most of which, as is well known, falls into the lacunae of our conscious
memory, is responsible for the production of interesting hypermnesic dreams,
of which I shall cite a few more examples.

<P>Maury relates (p. 92) that as a child he often went from his native
city, Meaux, to the neighbouring Trilport, where his father was superintending
the construction of a bridge. One night a dream transported him to Trilport
and he was once more playing in the streets there. A man approached him,
wearing a sort of uniform. Maury asked him his name, and he introduced
himself, saying that his name was C, and that he was a bridge-guard. On
waking, Maury, who still doubted the actuality of the reminiscence, asked
his old servant, who had been with him in his childhood, whether she remembered
a man of this name. "Of course," was the reply; "he used to be watchman
on the bridge which your father was building then."

<P>Maury records another example, which demonstrates no less clearly the
reliability of the reminiscences of childhood that emerge in our dreams.
M. F., who as a child had lived in Montbrison, decided, after an absence
of twenty-five years, to visit his home and the old friends of his family.
The night before his departure he dreamt that he had reached his destination,
and that near Montbrison he met a man whom he did not know by sight, and
who told him that he was M. F., a friend of his father's. The dreamer remembered
that as a child he had known a gentleman of this name, but on waking he
could no longer recall his features. Several days later, having actually
arrived at Montbrison, he found once more the locality of his dream, which
he had thought was unknown to him, and there he met a man whom he at once
recognized as the M. F. of his dream, with only this difference, that the
real person was very much older than his dream-image.

<P>Here I might relate one of my own dreams, in which the recalled impression
takes the form of an association. In my dream I saw a man whom I recognized,
while dreaming, as the doctor of my native town. His face was not distinct,
but his features were blended with those of one of my schoolmasters, whom
I still meet from time to time. What association there was between the
two persons I could not discover on waking, but upon questioning my mother
concerning the doctor I learned that he was a one- eyed man. The schoolmaster,
whose image in my dream obscured that of the physician, had also only one
eye. I had not seen the doctor for thirty- eight years, and as far as I
know I had never thought of him in my waking state, although a scar on
my chin might have reminded me of his professional attentions.

<P>As though to counterbalance the excessive part which is played in our
dreams by the impressions of childhood, many authors assert that the majority
of dreams reveal elements drawn from our most recent experiences. Robert
(p. 46) even declares that the normal dream generally occupies itself only
with the impressions of the last few days. We shall find, indeed, that
the theory of the dream advanced by Robert absolutely requires that our
oldest impressions should be thrust into the background, and our most recent
ones brought to the fore. However, the fact here stated by Robert is correct;
this I can confirm from my own investigations. Nelson, an American author,
holds that the impressions received in a dream most frequently date from
the second day before the dream, or from the third day before it, as though
the impressions of the day immediately preceding the dream were not sufficiently
weakened and remote.

<P>Many authors who are unwilling to question the intimate connection between
the dream-content and the waking state have been struck by the fact that
the impressions which have intensely occupied the waking mind appear in
dreams only after they have been to some extent removed from the mental
activities of the day. Thus, as a rule, we do not dream of a beloved person
who is dead while we are still overwhelmed with sorrow (Delage). Yet Miss
Hallam, one of the most recent observers, has collected examples which
reveal the very opposite behaviour in this respect, and upholds the claims
of psychological individuality in this matter.

<P>The third, most remarkable, and at the same time most incomprehensible,
peculiarity of memory in dreams is shown in the selection of the material
reproduced; for here it is not, as in the waking state, only the most significant
things that are held to be worth remembering, but also the most indifferent
and insignificant details. In this connection I will quote those authors
who have expressed their surprise in the most emphatic language.

<P>Hildebrandt (p. 11): "For it is a remarkable fact that dreams do not,
as a rule, take their elements from important and far-reaching events,
or from the intense and urgent interests of the preceding day, but from
unimportant incidents, from the worthless odds and ends of recent experience
or of the remoter past. The most shocking death in our family, the impressions
of which keep us awake long into the night, is obliterated from our memories
until the first moment of waking brings it back to us with distressing
force. On the other hand, the wart on the forehead of a passing stranger,
to whom we did not give a moment's thought once he was out of sight, finds
a place in our dreams."

<P>Strumpell (p. 39) speaks of "cases in which the analysis of a dream
brings to light elements which, although derived from the experiences of
yesterday or the day before yesterday, were yet so unimportant and worthless
for the waking state that they were forgotten soon after they were experienced.
Some experiences may be the chance-heard remarks of other persons, or their
superficially observed actions, or, fleeting perceptions of things or persons,
or isolated phrases that we have read, etc."

<P>Havelock Ellis (p. 727): "The profound emotions of waking life, the
questions and problems on which we spend our chief voluntary mental energy,
are not those which usually present themselves at once to dream- consciousness.
It is, so far as the immediate past is concerned, mostly the trifling,
the incidental, the 'forgotten' impressions of daily life which reappear
in our dreams. The psychic activities that are awake most intensely are
those that sleep most profoundly."

<P>It is precisely in connection with these characteristics of memory in
dreams that Binz (p. 45) finds occasion to express dissatisfaction with
the explanations of dreams which he himself had favoured: "And the normal
dream raises similar questions. Why do we not always dream of mental impressions
of the day before, instead of going back, without any perceptible reason,
to the almost forgotten past, now lying far behind us? Why, in a dream,
does consciousness so often revive the impression of indifferent memory-
pictures, while the cerebral cells that bear the most sensitive records
of experience remain for the most part inert and numb, unless an acute
revival during the waking state has quite recently excited them?"

<P>We can readily understand how the strange preference shown by the dream-
memory for the indifferent and therefore disregarded details of daily experience
must commonly lead us altogether to overlook the dependence of dreams on
the waking state, or must at least make it difficult for us to prove this
dependence in any individual case. Thus it happened that in the statistical
treatment of her own and her friend's dream, Miss Whiton Calkins found
that 11 per cent of the entire number showed no relation to the waking
state. Hildebrandt was certainly correct in his assertion that all our
dream-images could be genetically explained if we devoted enough time and
material to the tracing of their origin. To be sure, he calls this "a most
tedious and thankless job. For most often it would lead us to ferret out
all sorts of psychically worthless things from the remotest corners of
our storehouse of memories, and to bring to light all sorts of quite indifferent
events of long ago from the oblivion which may have overtaken them an hour
after their occurrence." I must, however, express my regret that this discerning
author refrained from following the path which at first sight seemed so
unpromising, for it would have led him directly to the central point of
the explanation of dreams.

<P>The behaviour of memory in dreams is surely most significant for any
theory of memory whatsoever. It teaches us that "nothing which we have
once psychically possessed is ever entirely lost" (Scholz, p. 34); or as
Delboeuf puts it, "que toute impression, meme la plus insignificante, laisse
une trace inalterable, indifiniment susceptible de reparaitre au jour";
* a conclusion to which we are urged by so many other pathological manifestations
of mental life. Let us bear in mind this extraordinary capacity of the
memory in dreams, in order the more keenly to realize the contradiction
which has to be put forward in certain dream-theories to be mentioned later,
which seek to explain the absurdities and incoherences of dreams by a partial
forgetting of what we have known during the day.

<P>* That every impression, even the most insignificant, leaves an ineradicable
mark, indefinitely capable of reappearing by day.

<P>It might even occur to one to reduce the phenomenon of dreaming to that
of remembering, and to regard the dream as the manifestation of a reproductive
activity, unresting even at night, which is an end in itself. This would
seem to be in agreement with statements such as those made by Pilcz, according
to which definite relations between the time of dreaming and the contents
of a dream may be demonstrated, inasmuch as the impressions reproduced
by the dream in deep sleep belong to the remote past, while those reproduced
towards morning are of recent origin. But such a conception is rendered
improbable from the outset by the manner in which the dream deals with
the material to be remembered. Strumpell rightly calls our attention to
the fact that repetitions of experiences do not occur in dreams. It is
true that a dream will make a beginning in that direction, but the next
link is wanting; it appears in a different form, or is replaced by something
entirely novel. The dream gives us only fragmentary reproductions; this
is so far the rule that it permits of a theoretical generalization. Still,
there are exceptions in which an episode is repeated in a dream as completely
as it can be reproduced by our waking memory. Delboeuf relates of one of
his university colleagues that a dream of his repeated, in all its details,
a perilous drive in which he escaped accident as if by miracle. Miss Calkins
mentions two dreams the contents of which exactly reproduced an experience
of the previous day, and in a later chapter I shall have occasion to give
an example that came to my knowledge of a childish experience which recurred
unchanged in a dream. *

<P>* From subsequent experience I am able to state that it is not at all
rare to find in dreams reproductions of simple and unimportant occupations
of everyday life, such as packing trunks, preparing food in the kitchen,
etc., but in such dreams the dreamer himself emphasizes not the character
of the recollection but its "reality"- "I really did this during the day."
<H3>
C. Dream-Stimuli and Sources</H3>
What is meant by dream-stimuli and dream-sources may be explained by a
reference to the popular saying: "Dreams come from the stomach." This notion
covers a theory which conceives the dream as resulting from a disturbance
of sleep. We should not have dreamed if some disturbing element had not
come into play during our sleep, and the dream is the reaction against
this disturbance.

<P>The discussion of the exciting causes of dreams occupies a great deal
of space in the literature of dreams. It is obvious that this problem could
have made its appearance only after dreams had become an object of biological
investigation. The ancients, who conceived of dreams as divine inspirations,
had no need to look for stimuli; for them a dream was due to the will of
divine or demonic powers, and its content was the product of their special
knowledge and intention. Science, however, immediately raised the question
whether the stimuli of dreams were single or multiple, and this in turn
led to the consideration whether the causal explanation of dreams belonged
to the region of psychology or to that of physiology. Most authors appear
to assume that disturbance of sleep, and hence dreams, may arise from various
causes, and that physical as well as mental stimuli may play the part of
dream-excitants. Opinions differ widely in preferring this or the other
factor as the cause of dreams, and in classifying them in the order of
importance.

<P>Whenever the sources of dreams are completely enumerated they fall into
the following four categories, which have also been employed in the classification
of dreams: (1) external (objective) sensory stimuli; (2) internal (subjective)
sensory stimuli; (3) internal (organic) physical stimuli; (4) Purely psychical
sources of excitation.
<H4>
1. External sensory stimuli</H4>
The younger Strumpell, the son of the philosopher, whose work on dreams
has already more than once served us as a guide in considering the problems
of dreams, has, as is well known, recorded his observations of a patient
afflicted with general anaesthesia of the skin and with paralysis of several
of the higher sensory organs. This man would laps into sleep whenever the
few remaining sensory paths between himself and the outer world were closed.
When we wish to fall asleep we are accustomed to strive for a condition
similar to that obtaining in Strumpell's experiment. We close the most
important sensory portals, the eyes, and we endeavour to protect the other
senses from all stimuli or from any change of the stimuli already acting
upon them. We then fall asleep, although our preparations are never wholly
successful. For we can never completely insulate the sensory organs, nor
can we entirely abolish the excitability of the sensory organs themselves.
That we may at any time be awakened by intenser stimuli should prove to
us "that the mind has remained in constant communication with the external
world even during sleep." The sensory stimuli that reach us during sleep
may easily become the source of dreams.

<P>There are a great many stimuli of this nature, ranging from those unavoidable
stimuli which are proper to the state of sleep or occasionally admitted
by it, to those fortuitous stimuli which are calculated to wake the sleeper.
Thus a strong light may fall upon the eyes, a noise may be heard, or an
odour may irritate the mucous membranes of the nose. In our unintentional
movements during sleep we may lay bare parts of the body, and thus expose
them to a sensation of cold, or by a change of position we may excite sensations
of pressure and touch. A mosquito may bite us, or a slight nocturnal mischance
may simultaneously attack more than one sense- organ. Observers have called
attention to a whole series of dreams in which the stimulus ascertained
on waking and some part of the dream-content corresponded to such a degree
that the stimulus could be recognized as the source of the dream.

<P>I shall here cite a number of such dreams, collected by Jessen (p. 527),
which are traceable to more or less accidental objective sensory stimuli.
Every noise indistinctly perceived gives rise to corresponding dream- representations;
the rolling of thunder takes us into the thick of battle, the crowing of
a cock may be transformed into human shrieks of terror, and the creaking
of a door may conjure up dreams of burglars breaking into the house. When
one of our blankets slips off us at night we may dream that we are walking
about naked, or falling into water. If we lie diagonally across the bed
with our feet extending beyond the edge, we may dream of standing on the
brink of a terrifying precipice, or of falling from a great height. Should
our head accidentally get under the pillow we may imagine a huge rock overhanging
us and about to crush us under its weight. An accumulation of semen produces
voluptuous dreams, and local pains give rise to ideas of suffering ill-treatment,
of hostile attacks, or of accidental bodily injuries....

<P>"Meier (Versuch einer Erklarung des Nachtwandelns, Halle, 1758, p. 33)
once dreamed of being attacked by several men who threw him flat on the
ground and drove a stake into the earth between his first and second toes.
While imagining this in his dream he suddenly awoke and felt a piece of
straw sticking between his toes. The same author, according to Hemmings
(Von den Traumen und Nachtwandlern, Weimar, 1784, p. 258), "dreamed on
another occasion, when his nightshirt was rather too tight round his neck,
that he was being hanged. In his youth Hoffbauer dreamed of having fallen
from a high wall, and found, on waking, that the bedstead had come apart,
and that he had actually fallen on to the floor.... Gregory relates that
he once applied a hot-water bottle to his feet, and dreamed of taking a
trip to the summit of Mount Etna, where he found the heat of the soil almost
unbearable. After having a blister applied to his head, another man dreamed
of being scalped by Indians; still another, whose shirt was damp, dreamed
that he was dragged through a stream. An attack of gout caused a patient
to believe that he was in the hands of the Inquisition, and suffering the
pains of torture (Macnish)."

<P>The argument that there is a resemblance between the dream-stimulus
and the dream-content would be confirmed if, by a systematic induction
of stimuli, we should succeed in producing dreams corresponding to these
stimuli. According to Macnish such experiments had already been made by
Giron de Buzareingues. "He left his knee exposed and dreamed of travelling
on a mail- coach by night. He remarked, in this connection, that travellers
were well aware how cold the knees become in a coach at night. On another
occasion he left the back of his head uncovered, and dreamed that he was
taking part in a religious ceremony in the open air. In the country where
he lived it was customary to keep the head always covered except on occasions
of this kind."

<P>Maury reports fresh observation on self-induced dreams of his own. (A
number of other experiments were unsuccessful.)

<P>1. He was tickled with a feather on his lips and on the tip of his nose.
He dreamed of an awful torture, viz., that a mask of pitch was stuck to
his face and then forcibly torn off, bringing the skin with it.

<P>2. Scissors were whetted against a pair of tweezers. He heard bells
ringing, then sounds of tumult which took him back to the days of the Revolution
of 1848.

<P>3. Eau de Cologne was held to his nostrils. He found himself in Cairo,
in the shop of Johann Maria Farina. This was followed by fantastic adventures
which he was not able to recall.

<P>4. His neck was lightly pinched. He dreamed that a blister was being
applied, and thought of a doctor who had treated him in childhood.

<P>5. A hot iron was brought near his face. He dreamed that chauffeurs
* had broken into the house, and were forcing the occupants to give up
their money by thrusting their feet into braziers. The Duchesse d'Abrantes,
whose secretary he imagined himself to be then entered the room.

<P>* Chauffeurs were bands of robbers in the Vendee who resorted to this
form of torture.

<P>6. A drop of water was allowed to fall on to his forehead. He imagined
himself in Italy, perspiring heavily, and drinking the white wine of Orvieto.

<P>7. When the light of a candle screened with red paper was allowed to
fall on his face, he dreamed of thunder, of heat, and of a storm at sea
which he once witnessed in the English Channel.

<P>Hervey, Weygandt, and others have made attempts to produce dreams experimentally.

<P>Many have observed the striking skill of the dream in interweaving into
its structure sudden impressions from the outer world, in such a manner
as to represent a gradually approaching catastrophe (Hildebrandt). "In
former years," this author relates, "I occasionally made use of an alarm-clock
in order to wake punctually at a certain hour in the morning. It probably
happened hundreds of times that the sound of this instrument fitted into
an apparently very long and connected dream, as though the entire dream
had been especially designed for it, as though it found in this sound its
appropriate and logically indispensable climax, its inevitable denouement."

<P>I shall presently have occasion to cite three of these alarm-clock dreams
in a different connection.

<P>Volkelt (p. 68) relates: "A composer once dreamed that he was teaching
a class, and was just explaining something to his pupils. When he had finished
he turned to one of the boys with the question: 'Did you understand me?'
The boy cried out like one possessed 'Oh, ja!' Annoyed by this, he reprimanded
his pupil for shouting. But now the entire class was screaming 'Orja,'
then 'Eurjo,' and finally 'Feuerjo.' He was then aroused by the actual
fire alarm in the street."

<P>Garnier (Traite des facultes de l'ame, 1865), on the authority of Radestock,
relates that Napoleon I, while sleeping in a carriage, was awakened from
a dream by an explosion which took him back to the crossing of the Tagliamento
and the bombardment of the Austrians, so that he started up, crying, "We
have been undermined."

<P>The following dream of Maury's has become celebrated: He was ill in
bed; his mother was sitting beside him. He dreamed of the Reign of Terror
during the Revolution. He witnessed some terrible scenes of murder, and
finally he himself was summoned before the Tribunal. There he saw Robespierre,
Marat, Fouquier-Tinville, and all the sorry heroes of those terrible days;
he had to give an account of himself, and after all manner of incidents
which did not fix themselves in his memory, he was sentenced to death.
Accompanied by an enormous crowd, he was led to the place of execution.
He mounted the scaffold; the executioner tied him to the plank, it tipped
over, and the knife of the guillotine fell. He felt his head severed from
his trunk, and awakened in terrible anxiety, only to find that the head-board
of the bed had fallen, and had actually struck the cervical vertebrae just
where the knife of the guillotine would have fallen.

<P>This dream gave rise to an interesting discussion, initiated by Le Lorrain
and Egger in the Revue Philosophique, as to whether, and how, it was possible
for the dreamer to crowd together an amount of dream-content apparently
so large in the short space of time elapsing between the perception of
the waking stimulus and the moment of actual waking.

<P>Examples of this nature show that objective stimuli occurring in sleep
are among the most firmly-established of all the sources of dreams; they
are, indeed, the only stimuli of which the layman knows anything whatever.
If we ask an educated person who is not familiar with the literature of
dreams how dreams originate, he is certain to reply by a reference to a
case known to him in which a dream has been explained after waking by a
recognized objective stimulus. Science, however, cannot stop here, but
is incited to further investigation by the observation that the stimulus
influencing the senses during sleep does not appear in the dream at all
in its true form, but is replaced by some other representation, which is
in some way related to it. But the relation existing between the stimulus
and the resulting dream is, according to Maury, "une affinite quelconque
mais qui n'est pas unique et exclusive" * (p. 72). If we read, for example,
three of Hildebrandt's "alarm-clock dreams," we shall be compelled to ask
why the same casual stimulus evoked so many different results, and why
just these results and no others.

<P>* A sort of relation which is, however, neither unique nor exclusive.

<P>(p. 37): "I am taking a walk on a beautiful spring morning. I stroll
through the green meadows to a neighbouring village, where I see numbers
of the inhabitants going to church, wearing their best clothes and carrying
their hymn-books under their arms. I remember that it is Sunday, and that
the morning service will soon begin. I decide to attend it, but as I am
rather overheated I think I will wait in the churchyard until I am cooler.
While reading the various epitaphs, I hear the sexton climbing the church-
tower, and I see above me the

<P>small bell which is about to ring for the beginning of service. For
a little while it hangs motionless; then it begins to swing, and suddenly
its notes resound so clearly and penetratingly that my sleep comes to an
end. But the notes of the bell come from the alarm-clock."

<P>"A second combination. It is a bright winter day; the streets are deep
in snow. I have promised to go on a sleigh-ride, but I have to wait some
time before I am told that the sleigh is at the door. Now I am preparing
to get into the sleigh. I put on my furs, the foot-warmer is put in, and
at last I have taken my seat. But still my departure is delayed. At last
the reins are twitched, the horses start, and the sleigh bells, now violently
shaken, strike up their familiar music with a force that instantly tears
the gossamer of my dream. Again it is only the shrill note of my alarm-
clock."

<P>"Yet a third example. I see the kitchen-maid walking along the passage
to the dining-room, with a pile of several dozen plates. The porcelain
column in her arms seems to me to be in danger of losing its equilibrium.
'Take care,' I exclaim, 'you will drop the whole pile!' The usual retort
is naturally made- that she is used to such things, etc. Meanwhile I continue
to follow her with my anxious gaze, and behold, at the threshold the fragile
plates fall and crash and roll across the floor in hundreds of pieces.
But I soon perceive that the endless din is not really a rattling but a
true ringing, and with this ringing the dreamer now becomes aware that
the alarm-clock has done its duty."

<P>The question why the dreaming mind misjudges the nature of the objective
sensory stimulus has been answered by Strumpell, and in an almost identical
fashion by Wundt; their explanation is that the reaction of the mind to
the stimulus attacking sleep is complicated and confused by the formation
of illusions. A sensory impression is recognized by us and correctly interpreted-
that is, it is classed with the memory-group to which it belongs according
to all previous experience if the impression is strong, clear, and sufficiently
prolonged, and if we have sufficient time to submit it to those mental
processes. But if these conditions are not fulfilled we mistake the object
which gives rise to the impression, and on the basis of this impression
we construct an illusion. "If one takes a walk in an open field and perceives
indistinctly a distant object, it may happen that one will at first take
it for a horse." On closer inspection the image of a cow, resting, may
obtrude itself, and the picture may finally resolve itself with certainty
into a group of people sitting on the ground. The impressions which the
mind receives during sleep from external stimuli are of a similarly indistinct
nature; they give rise to illusions because the impression evokes a greater
or lesser number of memory-images, through which it acquires its psychic
value. As for the question, in which of the many possible spheres of memory
the corresponding images are aroused, and which of the possible associative
connections are brought into play, that- to quote Strumpell again- is indeterminable,
and is left, as it were, to the caprices of the mind.

<P>Here we may take our choice. We may admit that the laws of dream-formation
cannot really be traced any further, and so refrain from asking whether
or not the interpretation of the illusion evoked by the sensory impression
depends upon still other conditions; or we may assume that the objective
sensory stimulus encroaching upon sleep plays only a modest role as a dream-
source, and that other factors determine the choice of the memory-image
to be evoked. Indeed, on carefully examining Maury's experimentally produced
dreams, which I have purposely cited in detail, one is inclined to object
that his investigations trace the origin of only one element of the dreams,
and that the rest of the dream-content seems too independent and too full
of detail to be explained by a single requirement, namely, that it must
correspond with the element experimentally introduced. Indeed, one even
begins to doubt the illusion theory, and the power of objective impressions
to shape the dream, when one realizes that such impressions are sometimes
subjected to the most peculiar and far-fetched interpretations in our dreams.
Thus M. Simon tells of a dream in which he saw persons of gigantic stature
* seated at a table, and heard distinctly the horrible clattering produced
by the impact of their jaws as they chewed their food. On waking he heard
the clatter of a horse's hooves as it galloped past his window. If in this
case the sound of the horse's hooves had revived ideas from the memory-sphere
of Gulliver's Travels, the sojourn with the giants of Brobdingnag, and
the virtuous horse-like creatures- as I should perhaps interpret the dream
without any assistance on the author's part- ought not the choice of a
memory-sphere so alien to the stimulus to be further elucidated by other
motives?

<P>* Gigantic persons in a dream justify the assumption that the dream
is dealing with a scene from the dreamer's childhood. This interpretation
of the dream as a reminiscence of Gulliver's Travels is, by the way, a
good example of how an interpretation should not be made. The dream-interpreter
should not permit his own intelligence to operate in disregard of the dreamer's
impressions.
<H4>
2. Internal (subjective) sensory stimuli</H4>
All objections to the contrary notwithstanding, we must admit that the
role of the objective sensory stimuli as producers of dreams has been indisputably
established, and if, having regard to their nature and their frequency,
these stimuli seem perhaps insufficient to explain all dream- pictures,
this indicates that we should look for other dream-sources which act in
a similar fashion. I do not know where the idea first arose that together
with the external sensory stimuli the internal (subjective) stimuli should
also be considered, but as a matter of fact this has been done more or
less explicitly in all the more recent descriptions of the aetiology of
dreams. "I believe," says Wundt (p. 363), "that an important part is played
in dream-illusions by those subjective sensations of sight and hearing
which are familiar to us in the waking state as a luminous chaos in the
dark field of the vision, and a ringing, buzzing, etc., of the ears, and
in especial, subjective irritations of the retina. This explains the remarkable
tendency of dreams to delude the eyes with numbers of similar or identical
objects. Thus we see outspread before our eyes innumerable birds, butterflies,
fishes, coloured beads, flowers, etc. Here the luminous dust in the dark
field of vision has assumed fantastic forms, and the many luminous points
of which it consists are embodied in our dreams in as many single images,
which, owing to the mobility of the luminous chaos, are seen as moving
objects. This is perhaps the reason of the dream's decided preference for
the most varied animal forms, for owing to the multiplicity of such forms
they can readily adapt themselves to the subjective luminous images."

<P>The subjective sensory stimuli as a source of dreams have the obvious
advantage that, unlike objective stimuli, they are independent of external
accidents. They are, so to speak, at the disposal of the interpretation
whenever they are required. But they are inferior to the objective sensory
stimuli by the fact that their claim to the role of dream-inciters- which
observation and experiment have established in the case of objective stimuli-
can in their case be verified with difficulty or not at all. The main proof
of the dream-inciting power of subjective sensory stimuli is afforded by
the so-called hypnogogic hallucinations, which have been described by Johann
Muller as "phantastic visual manifestations." They are those very vivid
and changeable pictures which with many people occur constantly during
the period of falling asleep, and which may linger for a while even after
the eyes have been opened. Maury, who was very subject to these pictures,
made a thorough study of them, and maintained that they were related to
or rather identical with dream-images. This had already been asserted by
Johann Muller. Maury maintains that a certain psychic passivity is necessary
for their origin; that it requires a relaxation of the intensity of attention
(p. 59). But one may perceive a hypnogogic hallucination in any frame of
mind if one falls into such a lethargy for a moment, after which one may
perhaps wake up, until this oft-repeated process terminates in sleep. According
to Maury, if one wakes up shortly after such an experience, it is often
possible to trace in the dream the images which one has perceived before
falling asleep as hypnogogic hallucinations (p. 134). Thus Maury on one
occasion saw a series of images of grotesque figures with distorted features
and curiously dressed hair, which obtruded themselves upon him with incredible
importunity during the period of falling asleep, and which, upon waking,
he recalled having seen in his dream. On another occasion, while suffering
from hunger, because he was subjecting himself to a rather strict diet,
he saw in one of his hypnogogic states a plate, and a hand armed with a
fork taking some food from the plate. In his dream he found himself at
a table abundantly supplied with food, and heard the clatter of the diner's
forks. On yet another occasion, after falling asleep with strained and
painful eyes, he had a hypnogogic hallucination of microscopically small
characters, which he was able to decipher, one by one, only with a great
effort; and on waking from sleep an hour later he recalled a dream in which
there was an open book with very small letters, which he was obliged to
read through with laborious effort.

<P>Not only pictures, but auditory hallucinations of words, names, etc.,
may also occur hypnogogically, and then repeat themselves in the dream,
like an overture announcing the principal motif of the opera which is to
follow.

<P>A more recent observer of hypnogogic hallucinations, G. Trumbull Ladd,
follows the same lines as Johann Muller and Maury. By dint of practice
he succeeded in acquiring the faculty of suddenly arousing himself, without
opening his eyes, two to five minutes after gradually falling asleep. This
enabled him to compare the disappearing retinal sensations with the dream-
images remaining in his memory. He assures us that an intimate relation
between the two can always be recognized, inasmuch as the luminous dots
and lines of light spontaneously perceived by the retina produce, so to
speak, the outline or scheme of the psychically perceived dream-images.
For example, a dream in which he saw before him clearly printed lines,
which he read and studied, corresponded with a number of luminous spots
arranged in parallel lines; or, to express it in his own words: The clearly
printed page resolved itself into an object which appeared to his waking
perception like part of an actual printed page seen through a small hole
in a sheet of paper, but at a distance too great to permit of its being
read. Without in any way underestimating the central element of the phenomenon,
Ladd believes that hardly any visual dream occurs in our minds that is
not based on material furnished by this internal condition of retinal irritability.
This is particularly true of dreams which occur shortly after falling asleep
in a dark room, while dreams occurring in the morning, near the period
of waking, receive their stimulus from the objective light penetrating
the eye in a brightly-lit room. The shifting and infinitely variable character
of the spontaneous luminous excitations of the retina exactly corresponds
with the fitful succession of images presented to us in our dreams. If
we attach any importance to Ladd's observations, we cannot underrate the
productiveness of this subjective source of stimuli; for visual images,
as we know, are the principal constituents of our dreams. The share contributed
by the other senses, excepting, perhaps, the sense of hearing, is relatively
insignificant and inconstant.
<H4>
3. Internal (organic) physical stimuli</H4>
If we are disposed to look for the sources of dreams not outside but inside
the organism, we must remember that almost all our internal organs, which
in a state of health hardly remind us of their existence, may, in states
of excitation- as we call them- or in disease, become a source of the most
painful sensations, and must therefore be put on a par with the external
excitants of pain and sensation. Strumpell, for example, gives expression
to a long-familiar experience when he declares that "during sleep the psyche
becomes far more deeply and broadly conscious of its coporality than in
the waking state, and it is compelled to receive and to be influenced by
certain stimulating impressions originating in parts of the body, and in
alterations of the body, of which it is unconscious in the waking state."
Even Aristotle declares it to be quite possible that a dream may draw our
attention to incipient morbid conditions which we have not noticed in the
waking state (owing to the exaggerated intensity of the impressions experienced
in the dream; and some medical authors, who certainly did not believe in
the prophetic nature of dreams, have admitted the significance of dreams,
at least in so far as the predicting of disease is concerned. [Cf. M. Simon,
p. 31, and many earlier writers.] *

<P>* In addition to the diagnostic valuation of dreams (e.g., by Hippocrates)
mention must also be made of their therapeutic significance in antiquity.

<P>Among the Greeks there were dream oracles, which were vouchsafed to
patients in quest of recovery. The patient betook himself to the temple
of Apollo or Aesculapius; there he was subjected to various ceremonies,
bathed, rubbed and perfumed. A state of exaltation having been thus induced,
he was made to lie down in the temple on the skin of a sacrificial ram.
He fell asleep and dreamed of remedies, which he saw in their natural form,
or in symbolic images which the priests afterwards interpreted.

<P>For further references concerning the remedial dreams of the Greeks,
cf. Lehmann, i, 74; Bouche-Leclerq; Hermann, Gottesd. Altert. d. Gr., SS
41; Privataltert. SS 38, 16; Bottinger in Sprengel's Beitr. z. Gesch. d.
Med., ii, p. 163, et seq.; W. Lloyd, Magnetism and Mesmerism in Antiquity,
London, 1877; Dollinger, Heidentum und Judentum, p. 130.

<P>Even in our days there seems to be no lack of authenticated examples
of such diagnostic achievements on the part of dreams. Thus Tissie cites
from Artigues (Essai sur la valeur semeiologique des Reves) the history
of a woman of forty-three, who, during several years of apparently perfect
health, was troubled with anxiety-dreams, and in whom a medical examination
subsequently revealed an incipient affection of the heart, to which she
presently succumbed.

<P>Serious derangements of the internal organs clearly excite dreams in
quite a number of persons. The frequency of anxiety-dreams in diseases
of the heart and lungs has been generally realized; indeed, this function
of the dream-life is emphasized by so many writers that I shall here content
myself with a reference to the literature of the subject (Radestock, Spitta,
Maury, M. Simon, Tissie). Tissie even believes that the diseased organs
impress upon the dream-content its characteristic features. The dreams
of persons suffering from diseases of the heart are generally very brief,
and end in a terrified awakening; death under terrible circumstances almost
always find a place in their content. Those suffering from diseases of
the lungs dream of suffocation, of being crushed, and of flight, and a
great many of them are subject to the familiar nightmare- which, by the
way, Borner has succeeded in inducing experimentally by lying on the face
and covering the mouth and nostrils. In digestive disturbances the dream
contains ideas from the sphere of gustatory enjoyment and disgust. Finally,
the influence of sexual excitement on the dream-content is obvious enough
in everyone's experience, and provides the strongest confirmation of the
whole theory of dream-instigation by organic sensation.

<P>Moreover, if we study the literature of dreams it becomes quite evident
that some writers (Maury, Weygandt) have been led to the study of dream-
problems by the influence their own pathological state has had on the content
of their dreams.

<P>The enlargement of the number of dream-sources by such undeniably established
facts is, however, not so important as one might be led to suppose; for
dreams are, after all, phenomena which occur in healthy persons- perhaps
in all persons, and every night- and a pathological state of the organs
is evidently not one of the indispensable conditions. For us, however,
the question is not whence particular dreams originate, but rather: what
is the exciting cause of ordinary dreams in normal people?

<P>But we have only to go a step farther to find a source of dreams which
is more prolific than any of those mentioned above, and which promises
indeed to be inexhaustible. If it is established that the bodily organs
become, in sickness, an exciting source of dreams, and if we admit that
the mind, when diverted during sleep from the outer world, can devote more
of its attention to the interior of the body, we may readily assume that
the organs need not necessarily become diseased in order to permit stimuli,
which in one way or another grow into dream-images, to reach the sleeping
mind. What in the waking state we vaguely perceive as a general sensation,
perceptible by its quality alone- a sensation to which, in the opinion
of physicians, all the organic systems contribute their share- this general
sensation would at night attain a greater potency, and, acting through
its individual components, would constitute the most prolific as well as
the most usual source of dream-representations. We should then have to
discover the laws by which organic stimuli are translated into dream- representations.

<P>This theory of the origin of dreams is the one most favoured by all
medical writers. The obscurity which conceals the essence of our being-
the "moi splanchnique" as Tissie terms it- from our knowledge, and the
obscurity of the origin of dreams, correspond so closely that it was inevitable
that they should be brought into relation with one another. The theory
according to which the organic sensations are responsible for dreams has,
moreover, another attraction for the physician, inasmuch as it favours
the aetiological union of the dream with mental derangement, both of which
reveal so many points of agreement in their manifestations, since changes
in the general organic massive sensation and in the stimuli emanating from
the internal organs are also considered to have a far-reaching significance
as regards the origin of the psychoses. It is therefore not surprising
that the organic stimulus theory can be traced to several writers who have
propounded this theory independently.

<P>A number of writers have followed the train of thought developed by
Schopenhauer in 1851. Our conception of the universe has its origin in
the recasting by the intellect of the impressions which reach it from without
in the moulds of time, space and causality. During the day the stimuli
proceeding from the interior of the organism, from the sympathetic nervous
system, exert at most an unconscious influence on our mood. At night, however,
when the overwhelming effect of the impressions of the day is no longer
operative, the impressions that surge upward from within are able to force
themselves on our attention- just as in the night we hear the rippling
of the brook that was drowned in the clamour of the day. But how else can
the intellect react to these stimuli than by transforming them in accordance
with its own function into things which occupy space and time and follow
the lines of causality?- and so a dream originates. Thus Scherner, and
after him Volkelt, endeavoured to discover the more intimate relations
between physical sensations and dream-pictures; but we shall reserve the
discussion of this point for our chapter on the theory of dreams.

<P>As a result of a singularly logical analysis, the psychiatrist Krauss
referred the origin of dreams, and also of deliria and delusions, to the
same element, namely, to organically determined sensations. According to
him, there is hardly any part of the organism which might not become the
starting-point of a dream or a delusion. Organically determined sensations,
he says, "may be divided into two classes: (1) general sensations- those
affecting the whole system; (2) specific sensations- those that are immanent
in the principal systems of the vegetative organism, and which may in turn
be subdivided into five groups: (a) the muscular, (b) the pneumatic, (c)
the gastric, (d) the sexual, (e) the peripheral sensations (p. 33 of the
second article)."

<P>The origin of the dream-image from physical sensations is conceived
by Krauss as follows: The awakened sensation, in accordance with some law
of association, evokes an idea or image bearing some relation to it, and
combines with this idea or image, forming an organic structure, towards
which, however, the consciousness does not maintain its normal attitude.
For it does not bestow any attention on the sensation, but concerns itself
entirely with the accompanying ideas; and this explains why the facts of
the case have been so long misunderstood (p. 11 ff.). Krauss even gives
this process the special name of "transubstantiation of the sensations
into dream-images" (p. 24).

<P>The influence of organic physical stimuli on the formation of dreams
is today almost universally admitted, but the question as to the nature
of the law underlying this relation is answered in various ways, and often
obscurely. On the basis of the theory of physical excitation the special
task of dream-interpretation is to trace back the content of a dream to
the causative organic stimulus, and if we do not accept the rules of interpretation
advanced by Scherner, we shall often find ourselves confronted by the awkward
fact that the organic source of excitation reveals itself only in the content
of the dream.

<P>A certain agreement, however, appears in the interpretation of the various
forms of dreams which have been designated as "typical," because they recur
in so many persons with almost the same content. Among these are the well-
known dreams of falling from a height, of the dropping out of teeth, of
flying, and of embarrassment because one is naked or scantily clad. This
last type of dream is said to be caused simply by the dreamer's perception,
felt in his sleep, that he has thrown off the bedclothes and is uncovered.
The dream that one's teeth are dropping out is explained by "dental irritation,"
which does not, however, of necessity imply a morbid condition of irritability
in the teeth. According to Strumpell, the flying dream is the adequate
image employed by the mind to interpret the quantum of stimulus emanating
from the rising and sinking of the pulmonary lobes when the cutaneous sensation
of the thorax has lapsed into insensibility. This latter condition causes
the sensation which gives rise to images of hovering in the air. The dream
of falling from a height is said to be due to the fact that an arm falls
away from the body, or a flexed knee is suddenly extended, after unconsciousness
of the sensation of cutaneous pressure has supervened, whereupon this sensation
returns to consciousness, and the transition from unconsciousness to consciousness
embodies itself psychically as a dream of falling (Strumpell, p. 118).
The weakness of these fairly plausible attempts at explanation clearly
lies in the fact that without any further elucidation they allow this or
that group of organic sensations to disappear from psychic perception,
or to obtrude themselves upon it, until the constellation favourable for
the explanation has been established. Later on, however, I shall have occasion
to return to the subject of typical dreams and their origin.

<P>From a comparison of a series of similar dreams, M. Simon endeavoured
to formulate certain rules governing the influence of organic sensations
on the nature of the resulting dream. He says (p. 34): "If during sleep
any organic apparatus, which normally participates in the expression of
an affect, for any reason enters into the state of excitation to which
it is usually aroused by the affect, the dream thus produced will contain
representations which harmonize with that affect."

<P>Another rule reads as follows (p. 35): "If, during sleep, an organic
apparatus is in a state of activity, stimulation, or disturbance, the dream
will present ideas which correspond with the nature of the organic function
performed by that apparatus."

<P>Mourly Vold has undertaken to prove the supposed influence of bodily
sensation on the production of dreams by experimenting on a single physiological
territory. He changed the positions of a sleeper's limbs, and compared
the resulting dreams with these changes. He recorded the following results:

<P>1. The position of a limb in a dream corresponds approximately to that
of reality, i.e., we dream of a static condition of the limb which corresponds
with the actual condition.

<P>2. When one dreams of a moving limb it always happens that one of the
positions occurring in the execution of this movement corresponds with
the actual position.

<P>3. The position of one's own limb may in the dream be attributed to
another person.

<P>4. One may also dream that the movement in question is impeded.

<P>5. The limb in any particular position may appear in the dream as an
animal or monster, in which case a certain analogy between the two is established.

<P>6. The behaviour of a limb may in the dream incite ideas which bear
some relation or other to this limb. Thus, for example, if we are using
our fingers we dream of numerals.

<P>Results such as these would lead me to conclude that even the theory
of organic stimulation cannot entirely abolish the apparent freedom of
the determination of the dream-picture which will be evoked. *

<P>* See below for a further discussion of the two volumes of records of
dreams since published by this writer.

4. Psychic sources of excitation</H4>
When considering the relation of dreams to waking life, and the provenance
of the material of dreams, we learned that the earliest as well as the
most recent investigators are agreed that men dream of what they do during
the day, and of the things that interest them in the waking state. This
interest, continued from waking life into sleep, is not only a psychic
bond, joining the dream to life, but it is also a source of dreams whose
importance must not be underestimated, and which, taken together with those
stimuli which become active and of interest during sleep, suffices to explain
the origin of all dream-images. Yet we have also heard the very contrary
of this asserted; namely, that dreams bear the sleeper away from the interests
of the day, and that in most cases we do not dream of things which have
occupied our attention during the day until after they have lost, for our
waking life, the stimulating force of belonging to the present. Hence in
the analysis of dream-life we are reminded at every step that it is inadmissible
to frame general rules without making provision for qualifications by introducing
such terms as "frequently," "as a rule," "in most cases," and without being
prepared to admit the validity of exceptions.

<P>If interest during the waking state together with the internal and external
stimuli that occur during sleep, sufficed to cover the whole aetiology
of dreams, we should be in a position to give a satisfactory account of
the origin of all the elements of a dream; the problem of the dream-sources
would then be solved, leaving us only the task of discriminating between
the part played by the psychic and that played by the somatic dream-stimuli
in individual dreams. But as a matter of fact no such complete solution
of a dream has ever been achieved in any case, and everyone who has attempted
such a solution has found that components of the dream- and usually a great
many of them- are left whose source he is unable to trace. The interests
of the day as a psychic source of dreams are obviously not so influential
as to justify the confident assertion that every dreamer continues the
activities of his waking life in his dreams.

<P>Other dream-sources of a psychic nature are not known. Hence, with the
exception perhaps of the explanation of dreams given by Scherner, to which
reference will be made later on, all the explanations found in the literature
of the subject show a considerable hiatus whenever there is a question
of tracing the images and ideas which are the most characteristic material
of dreams. In this dilemma the majority of authors have developed a tendency
to belittle as far as possible the share of the psychic factor, which is
so difficult to determine, in the evocation of dreams. To be sure, they
distinguish as major divisions the nerve-stimulus dream and the association-dream,
and assert that the latter has its source exclusively in reproduction (Wundt,
p. 365), but they cannot dismiss the doubt as to "whether they appear without
any impulsion from organic stimuli" (Volkelt, p. 127). And even the characteristic
quality of the pure association-dream disappears. To quote Volkelt (p.
118): "In the association-dream proper, there is no longer any question
of such a stable nucleus. Here the loose grouping penetrates even to the
very centre of the dream. The imaginative life, already released from the
control of reason and intellect, is here no longer held together by the
more important psychical and physical stimuli, but is left to its own uncontrolled
and confused divagations." Wundt, too, attempts to belittle the psychic
factor in the evocation of dreams by asserting that "the phantasms of the
dream are perhaps unjustly regarded as pure hallucinations. Probably most
dream-representations are really illusions, inasmuch as they emanate from
the slight sensory impressions which are never extinguished during sleep"
(p. 359, et seq.). Weygandt has adopted this view, and generalizes upon
it. He asserts that "the most immediate causes of all dream-representations
are sensory stimuli to which reproductive associations then attach themselves"
(p. 17). Tissie goes still further in suppressing the psychic sources of
excitation (p. 183): "Les reves d'origine absolument psychique n'existent
pas"; * and elsewhere (p. 6), "Les pensees de nos reves nous viennent de
dehors...." *(2)

<P>* Dreams do not exist whose origin is totally psychic.

<P>*(2) The thoughts of our dreams come from outside.

<P>Those writers who, like the eminent philosopher Wundt, adopt a middle
course, do not hesitate to assert that in most dreams there is a cooperation
of the somatic stimuli and psychic stimuli which are either unknown or
are identified with the interests of the day.

<P>We shall learn later that the problem of dream-formation may be solved
by the disclosure of an entirely unsuspected psychic source of excitation.
In the meanwhile we shall not be surprised at the over-estimation of the
influence of those stimuli which do not originate in the psychic life.
It is not merely because they alone may easily be found, and even confirmed
by experiment, but because the somatic conception of the origin of dreams
entirely corresponds with the mode of thought prevalent in modern psychiatry.
Here, it is true, the mastery of the brain over the organism is most emphatically
stressed; but everything that might show that the psychic life is independent
of demonstrable organic changes, or spontaneous in its manifestations,
is alarming to the contemporary psychiatrist, as though such an admission
must mean a return to the old-world natural philosophy and the metaphysical
conception of the nature of the soul. The distrust of the psychiatrist
has placed the psyche under tutelage, so to speak; it requires that none
of the impulses of the psyche shall reveal an autonomous power. Yet this
attitude merely betrays a lack of confidence in the stability of the causal
concatenation between the physical and the psychic. Even where on investigation
the psychic may be recognized as the primary cause of a phenomenon, a more
profound comprehension of the subject will one day succeed in following
up the path that leads to the organic basis of the psychic. But where the
psychic must, in the present state of our knowledge, be accepted as the
terminus, it need not on that account be disavowed.
