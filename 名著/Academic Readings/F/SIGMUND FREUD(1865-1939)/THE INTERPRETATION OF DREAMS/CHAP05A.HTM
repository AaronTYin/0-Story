V. THE MATERIAL AND SOURCES OF DREAMS</H2></CENTER>
HAVING realized, as a result of analysing the dream of Irma's injection,
that the dream was the fulfilment of a wish, we were immediately interested
to ascertain whether we had thereby discovered a general characteristic
of dreams, and for the time being we put aside every other scientific problem
which may have suggested itself in the course of the interpretation. Now
that we have reached the goal on this one path, we may turn back and select
a new point of departure for exploring dream-problems, even though we may
for a time lose sight of the theme of wish- fulfilment, which has still
to be further considered.

<P>&nbsp;Now that we are able, by applying our process of interpretation,
to detect a latent dream-content whose significance far surpasses that
of the manifest dream-content, we are naturally impelled to return to the
individual dream-problems, in order to see whether the riddles and contradictions
which seemed to elude us when we had only the manifest content to work
upon may not now be satisfactorily solved.

<P>&nbsp;The opinions of previous writers on the relation of dreams to
waking life, and the origin of the material of dreams, have not been given
here. We may recall however three peculiarities of the memory in dreams,
which have been often noted, but never explained:

<P>&nbsp;1. That the dream clearly prefers the impressions of the last
few days (Robert, Strumpell, Hildebrandt; also Weed-Hallam);

<P>&nbsp;2. That it makes a selection in accordance with principles other
than those governing our waking memory, in that it recalls not essential
and important, but subordinate and disregarded things;

<P>&nbsp;3. That it has at its disposal the earliest impressions of our
childhood, and brings to light details from this period of life, which,
again, seem trivial to us, and which in waking life were believed to have
been long since forgotten. *

<P>* It is evident that Robert's idea- that the dream is intended to rid
our memory of the useless impressions which it has received during the
day- is no longer tenable if indifferent memories of our childhood appear
in our dreams with some degree of frequency. We should be obliged to conclude
that our dreams generally perform their prescribed task very inadequately.

<P>These peculiarities in the dream's choice of material have, of course,
been observed by previous writers in the manifest dream- content.

<H3>
A. Recent and Indifferent Impressions in the Dream</H3>
If I now consult my own experience with regard to the origin of the elements
appearing in the dream-content, I must in the first place express the opinion
that in every dream we may find some reference to the experiences of the
preceding day. Whatever dream I turn to, whether my own or someone else's,
this experience is always confirmed. Knowing this, I may perhaps begin
the work of interpretation by looking for the experience of the preceding
day which has stimulated the dream; in many cases this is indeed the quickest
way. With the two dreams which I subjected to a close analysis in the last
chapter (the dreams of Irma's injection, and of the uncle with the yellow
beard) the reference to the preceding day is so evident that it needs no
further elucidation. But in order to show how constantly this reference
may be demonstrated, I shall examine a portion of my own dream- chronicle,
I shall relate only so much of the dreams as is necessary for the detection
of the dream-source in question.

<P>&nbsp;1. I pay a call at a house to which I gain admittance only with
difficulty, etc., and meanwhile I am keeping a woman waiting for me.

<P>&nbsp;Source: A conversation during the evening with a female relative
to the effect that she would have to wait for a remittance for which she
had asked, until... etc.

<P>&nbsp;2. I have written a monograph on a species (uncertain) of plant.

<P>&nbsp;Source: In the morning I had seen in a bookseller's window a monograph
on the genus Cyclamen.

<P>&nbsp;3. I see two women in the street, mother and daughter, the latter
being a patient.

<P>&nbsp;Source: A female patient who is under treatment had told me in
the evening what difficulties her mother puts in the way of her continuing
the treatment.

<P>&nbsp;4. At S and R's bookshop I subscribe to a periodical which costs
20 florins annually.

<P>&nbsp;Source: During the day my wife has reminded me that I still owe
her 20 florins of her weekly allowance.

<P>&nbsp;5. I receive a communication from the Social Democratic Committee,
in which I am addressed as a member.

<P>&nbsp;Source: I have received simultaneous communications from the Liberal
Committee on Elections and from the president of the Humanitarian Society,
of which latter I am actually a member.

<P>&nbsp;6. A man on a steep rock rising from the sea, in the manner of
Bocklin.

<P>&nbsp;Source: Dreyfus on Devil's Island; also news from my relatives
in England, etc.

<P>&nbsp;The question might be raised, whether a dream invariably refers
to the events of the preceding day only, or whether the reference may be
extended to include impressions from a longer period of time in the immediate
past. This question is probably not of the first importance, but I am inclined
to decide in favour of the exclusive priority of the day before the dream
(the dream-day). Whenever I thought I had found a case where an impression
two or three days old was the source of the dream, I was able to convince
myself after careful investigation that this impression had been remembered
the day before; that is, that a demonstrable reproduction on the day before
had been interpolated between the day of the event and the time of the
dream; and further, I was able to point to the recent occasion which might
have given rise to the recollection of the older impression. On the other
hand, I was unable to convince myself that a regular interval of biological
significance (H. Swoboda gives the first interval of this kind as eighteen
hours) elapses between the dream-exciting daytime impression and its recurrence
in the dream.

<P>&nbsp;I believe, therefore, that for every dream a dream-stimulus may
be found among these experiences "on which one has not yet slept."

<P>&nbsp;Havelock Ellis, who has likewise given attention to this problem,
states that he has not been able to find any such periodicity of reproduction
in his dreams, although he has looked for it. He relates a dream in which
he found himself in Spain; he wanted to travel to a place called Daraus,
Varaus, or Zaraus. On awaking he was unable to recall any such place-names,
and thought no more of the matter. A few months later he actually found
the name Zaraus; it was that of a railway-station between San Sebastian
and Bilbao, through which he had passed in the train eight months (250
days) before the date of the dream.

<P>&nbsp;Thus the impressions of the immediate past (with the exception
of the day before the night of the dream) stand in the same relation to
the dream-content as those of periods indefinitely remote. The dream may
select its material from any period of life, provided only that a chain
of thought leads back from the experiences of the day of the dream (the
recent impressions) of that earlier period.

<P>&nbsp;But why this preference for recent impressions? We shall arrive
at some conjectures on this point if we subject one of the dreams already
mentioned to a more precise analysis. I select the

<P>Dream of the Botanical Monograph

<P>I have written a monograph on a certain plant. The book lies before
me; I am just turning over a folded coloured plate. A dried specimen of
the plant, as though from a herbarium, is bound up with every copy.
<H4>
Analysis</H4>
In the morning I saw in a bookseller's window a volume entitled The Genus
Cyclamen, apparently a monograph on this plant.

<P>&nbsp;The cyclamen is my wife's favorite flower. I reproach myself for
remembering so seldom to bring her flowers, as she would like me to do.
In connection with the theme of giving her flowers, I am reminded of a
story which I recently told some friends of mine in proof of my assertion
that we often forget in obedience to a purpose of the unconscious, and
that forgetfulness always enables us to form a deduction about the secret
disposition of the forgetful person. A young woman who has been accustomed
to receive a bouquet of flowers from her husband on her birthday misses
this token of affection on one of her birthdays, and bursts into tears.
The husband comes in, and cannot understand why she is crying until she
tells him: "Today is my birthday." He claps his hand to his forehead, and
exclaims: "Oh, forgive me, I had completely forgotten it!" and proposes
to go out immediately in order to get her flowers. But she refuses to be
consoled, for she sees in her husband's forgetfulness a proof that she
no longer plays the same part in his thoughts as she formerly did. This
Frau L met my wife two days ago, told her that she was feeling well, and
asked after me. Some years ago she was a patient of mine.

<P>&nbsp;Supplementary facts: I did once actually write something like
a monograph on a plant, namely, an essay on the coca plant, which attracted
the attention of K. Koller to the anaesthetic properties of cocaine. I
had hinted that the alkaloid might be employed as an anaesthetic, but I
was not thorough enough to pursue the matter farther. It occurs to me,
too, that on the morning of the day following the dream (for the interpretation
of which I did not find time until the evening) I had thought of cocaine
in a kind of day-dream. If I were ever afflicted with glaucoma, I would
go to Berlin, and there undergo an operation, incognito, in the house of
my Berlin friend, at the hands of a surgeon whom he would recommend. The
surgeon, who would not know the name of his patient, would boast, as usual,
how easy these operations had become since the introduction of cocaine;
and I should not betray the fact that I myself had a share in this discovery.
With this phantasy were connected thoughts of how awkward it really is
for a physician to claim the professional services of a colleague. I should
be able to pay the Berlin eye specialist, who did not know me, like anyone
else. Only after recalling this day-dream do I realize that there is concealed
behind it the memory of a definite event. Shortly after Koller's discovery,
my father contracted glaucoma; he was operated on by my friend Dr. Koenigstein,
the eye specialist. Dr. Koller was in charge of the cocaine anaesthetization,
and he made the remark that on this occasion all the three persons who
had been responsible for the introduction of cocaine had been brought together.

<P>&nbsp;My thoughts now pass on to the time when I was last reminded of
the history of cocaine. This was a few days earlier, when I received a
Festschrift, a publication in which grateful pupils had commemorated the
jubilee of their teacher and laboratory director. Among the titles to fame
of persons connected with the laboratory I found a note to the effect that
the discovery of the anaesthetic properties of cocaine had been due to
K. Koller. Now I suddenly become aware that the dream is connected with
an experience of the previous evening. I had just accompanied Dr. Koenigstein
to his home, and had entered into a discussion of a subject which excites
me greatly whenever it is mentioned. While I was talking with him in the
entrance-hall Professor Gartner and his young wife came up. I could not
refrain from congratulating them both upon their blooming appearance. Now
Professor Gartner is one of the authors of the Festschrift of which I have
just spoken, and he may well have reminded me of it. And Frau L, of whose
birthday disappointment I spoke a little way back, had been mentioned,
though of course in another connection, in my conversation with Dr. Koenigstein.

<P>&nbsp;I shall now try to elucidate the other determinants of the dream-
content. A dried specimen of the plant accompanies the monograph, as though
it were a herbarium. And herbarium reminds me of the Gymnasium. The director
of our Gymnasium once called the pupils of the upper classes together,
in order that they might examine and clean the Gymnasium herbarium. Small
insects had been found- book-worms. The director seemed to have little
confidence in my ability to assist, for he entrusted me with only a few
of the pages. I know to this day that there were crucifers on them. My
interest in botany was never very great. At my preliminary examination
in botany I was required to identify a crucifer, and failed to recognize
it; had not my theoretical knowledge come to my aid, I should have fared
badly indeed. Crucifers suggest composites. The artichoke is really a composite,
and in actual fact one which I might call my favourite flower. My wife,
more thoughtful than I, often brings this favourite flower of mine home
from the market.

<P>&nbsp;I see the monograph which I have written lying before me. Here
again there is an association. My friend wrote to me yesterday from Berlin:
"I am thinking a great deal about your dream-book. I see it lying before
me, completed, and I turn the pages." How I envied him this power of vision!
If only I could see it lying before me, already completed!

<P>&nbsp;The folded coloured plate. When I was a medical student I suffered
a sort of craze for studying monographs exclusively. In spite of my limited
means, I subscribed to a number of the medical periodicals, whose coloured
plates afforded me much delight. I was rather proud of this inclination
to thoroughness. When I subsequently began to publish books myself, I had
to draw the plates for my own treatises, and I remember one of them turned
out so badly that a well-meaning colleague ridiculed me for it. With this
is associated, I do not exactly know how, a very early memory of my childhood.
My father, by the way of a jest, once gave my elder sister and myself a
book containing coloured plates (the book was a narrative of a journey
through Persia) in order that we might destroy it. From an educational
point of view this was hardly to be commended. I was at the time five years
old, and my sister less than three, and the picture of us two children
blissfully tearing the book to pieces (I should add, like an artichoke,
leaf by leaf), is almost the only one from this period of my life which
has remained vivid in my memory. When I afterwards became a student, I
developed a conspicuous fondness for collecting and possessing books (an
analogy to the inclination for studying from monographs, a hobby alluded
to in my dream-thoughts, in connection with cyclamen and artichoke). I
became a book-worm (cf. herbarium). Ever since I have been engaged in introspection
I have always traced this earliest passion of my life to this impression
of my childhood: or rather, I have recognized in this childish scene a
screen or concealing memory for my subsequent bibliophilia. * And of course
I learned at an early age that our passions often become our misfortunes.
When I was seventeen, I ran up a very considerable account at the bookseller's,
with no means with which to settle it, and my father would hardly accept
it as an excuse that my passion was at least a respectable one. But the
mention of this experience of my youth brings me back to my conversation
with my friend Dr. Koenigstein on the evening preceding the dream; for
one of the themes of this conversation was the same old reproach- that
I am much too absorbed in my hobbies.

<P>* Cf. The Psycho-pathology of Everyday Life.

<P>For reasons which are not relevant here I shall not continue the interpretation
of this dream, but will merely indicate the path which leads to it. In
the course of the interpretation I was reminded of my conversation with
Dr. Koenigstein, and, indeed, of more than one portion of it. When I consider
the subjects touched upon in this conversation, the meaning of the dream
immediately becomes clear to me. All the trains of thought which have been
started- my own inclinations, and those of my wife, the cocaine, the awkwardness
of securing medical treatment from one's own colleagues, my preference
for monographical studies, and my neglect of certain subjects, such as
botany- all these are continued in and lead up to one branch or another
of this widely- ramified conversation. The dream once more assumes the
character of a justification, of a plea for my rights (like the dream of
Irma's injection, the first to be analysed); it even continues the theme
which that dream introduced, and discusses it in association with the new
subject-matter which has been added in the interval between the two dreams.
Even the dream's apparently indifferent form of expression at once acquires
a meaning. Now it means: "I am indeed the man who has written that valuable
and successful treatise (on cocaine)," just as previously I declared in
self-justification: "I am after all a thorough and industrious student";
and in both instances I find the meaning: "I can allow myself this." But
I may dispense with the further interpretation of the dream, because my
only purpose in recording it was to examine the relation of the dream-content
to the experience of the previous day which arouses it. As long as I know
only the manifest content of this dream, only one relation to any impression
of the day is obvious; but after I have completed the interpretation, a
second source of the dream becomes apparent in another experience of the
same day. The first of these impressions to which the dream refers is an
indifferent one, a subordinate circumstance. I see a book in a shop window
whose title holds me for a moment, but whose contents would hardly interest
me. The second experience was of great psychic value; I talked earnestly
with my friend, the eye specialist, for about an hour; I made allusions
in this conversation which must have ruffled the feelings of both of us,
and which in me awakened memories in connection with which I was aware
of a great variety of inner stimuli. Further, this conversation was broken
off unfinished, because some acquaintances joined us. What, now, is the
relation of these two impressions of the day to one another, and to the
dream which followed during the night?

<P>&nbsp;In the manifest dream-content I find merely an allusion to the
indifferent impression, and I am thus able to reaffirm that the dream prefers
to take up into its content experiences of a non- essential character.
In the dream-interpretation, on the contrary, everything converges upon
the important and justifiably disturbing event. If I judge the sense of
the dream in the only correct way, according to the latent content which
is brought to light in the analysis, I find that I have unwittingly lighted
upon a new and important discovery. I see that the puzzling theory that
the dream deals only with the worthless odds and ends of the day's experiences
has no justification; I am also compelled to contradict the assertion that
the psychic life of the waking state is not continued in the dream, and
that hence, the dream wastes our psychic energy on trivial material. The
very opposite is true; what has claimed our attention during the day dominates
our dream-thoughts also, and we take pains to dream only in connection
with such matters as have given us food for thought during the day.

<P>&nbsp;Perhaps the most immediate explanation of the fact that I dream
of the indifferent impression of the day, while the impression which has
with good reason excited me causes me to dream, is that here again we are
dealing with the phenomenon of dream- distortion, which we have referred
to as a psychic force playing the part of a censorship. The recollection
of the monograph on the genus cyclamen is utilized as though it were an
allusion to the conversation with my friend, just as the mention of my
patient's friend in the dream of the deferred supper is represented by
the allusion smoked salmon. The only question is: by what intermediate
links can the impression of the monograph come to assume the relation of
allusion to the conversation with the eye specialist, since such a relation
is not at first perceptible? In the example of the deferred supper, the
relation is evident at the outset; smoked salmon, as the favourite dish
of the patient's friend, belongs to the circle of ideas which the friend's
personality would naturally evoke in the mind of the dreamer. In our new
example we are dealing with two entirely separate impressions, which at
first glance seem to have nothing in common, except indeed that they occur
on the same day. The monograph attracts my attention in the morning: in
the evening I take part in the conversation. The answer furnished by the
analysis is as follows: Such relations between the two impressions as do
not exist from the first are established subsequently between the idea-content
of the one impression and the idea-content of the other. I have already
picked out the intermediate links emphasized in the course of writing the
analysis. Only under some outside influence, perhaps the recollection of
the flowers missed by Frau L, would the idea of the monograph on the cyclamen
have attached itself to the idea that the cyclamen is my wife's favourite
flower. I do not believe that these inconspicuous thoughts would have sufficed
to evoke a dream.

<P>There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave

<P>&nbsp;To tell us this,

<P>as we read in Hamlet. But behold! in the analysis I am reminded that
the name of the man who interrupted our conversation was Gartner (gardener),
and that I thought his wife looked blooming; indeed, now I even remember
that one of my female patients, who bears the pretty name of Flora, was
for a time the main subject of our conversation. It must have happened
that by means of these intermediate links from the sphere of botanical
ideas the association was effected between the two events of the day, the
indifferent one and the stimulating one. Other relations were then established,
that of cocaine for example, which can with perfect appropriateness form
a link between the person of Dr. Koenigstein and the botanical monograph
which I have written, and thus secure the fusion of the two circles of
ideas, so that now a portion of the first experience may be used as an
allusion to the second.

<P>&nbsp;I am prepared to find this explanation attacked as either arbitrary
or artificial. What would have happened if Professor Gartner and his blooming
wife had not appeared, and if the patient who was under discussion had
been called, not Flora, but Anna? And yet the answer is not hard to find.
If these thought- relations had not been available, others would probably
have been selected. It is easy to establish relations of this sort, as
the jocular questions and conundrums with which we amuse ourselves suffice
to show. The range of wit is unlimited. To go a step farther: if no sufficiently
fertile associations between the two impressions of the day could have
been established, the dream would simply have followed a different course;
another of the indifferent impressions of the day, such as come to us in
multitudes and are forgotten, would have taken the place of the monograph
in the dream, would have formed an association with the content of the
conversation, and would have represented this in the dream. Since it was
the impression of the monograph and no other that was fated to perform
this function, this impression was probably that most suitable for the
purpose. One need not, like Lessing's Hanschen Schlau, be astonished that
"only the rich people of the world possess the most money."

<P>&nbsp;Still the psychological process by which, according to our exposition,
the indifferent experience substitutes itself for the psychologically important
one seems to us odd and open to question. In a later chapter we shall undertake
the task of making the peculiarities of this seemingly incorrect operation
more intelligible. Here we are concerned only with the result of this process,
which we were compelled to accept by constantly recurring experiences in
the analysis of dreams. In this process it is as though, in the course
of the intermediate steps, a displacement occurs- let us say, of the psychic
accent- until ideas of feeble potential, by taking over the charge from
ideas which have a stronger initial potential, reach a degree of intensity
which enables them to force their way into consciousness. Such displacements
do not in the least surprise us when it is a question of the transference
of affective magnitudes or of motor activities. That the lonely spinster
transfers her affection to animals, that the bachelor becomes a passionate
collector, that the soldier defends a scrap of coloured cloth- his flag-
with his life-blood, that in a love-affair a clasp of the hands a moment
longer than usual evokes a sensation of bliss, or that in Othello a lost
handkerchief causes an outburst of rage- all these are examples of psychic
displacements which to us seem incontestable. But if, by the same means,
and in accordance with the same fundamental principles, a decision is made
as to what is to reach our consciousness and what is to be withheld from
it- that is to say, what we are to think- this gives us the impression
of morbidity, and if it occurs in waking life we call it an error of thought.
We may here anticipate the result of a discussion which will be undertaken
later, namely, that the psychic process which we have recognized in dream-displacement
proves to be not a morbidly deranged process, but one merely differing
from the normal, one of a more primary nature.

<P>&nbsp;Thus we interpret the fact that the dream-content takes up remnants
of trivial experiences as a manifestation of dream- distortion (by displacement),
and we thereupon remember that we have recognized this dream-distortion
as the work of a censorship operating between the two psychic instances.
We may therefore expect that dream-analysis will constantly show us the
real and psychically significant source of the dream in the events of the
day, the memory of which has transferred its accentuation to some indifferent
memory. This conception is in complete opposition to Robert's theory, which
consequently has no further value for us. The fact which Robert was trying
to explain simply does not exist; its assumption is based on a misunderstanding,
on a failure to substitute the real meaning of the dream for its apparent
meaning. A further objection to Robert's doctrine is as follows: If the
task of the dream were really to rid our memory, by means of a special
psychic activity, of the slag of the day's recollections, our sleep would
perforce be more troubled, engaged in more strenuous work, than we can
suppose it to be, judging by our waking thoughts. For the number of the
indifferent impressions of the day against which we should have to protect
our memory is obviously immeasurably large; the whole night would not be
long enough to dispose of them all. It is far more probable that the forgetting
of the indifferent impressions takes place without any active interference
on the part of our psychic powers.

<P>&nbsp;Still, something cautions us against taking leave of Robert's
theory without further consideration. We have left unexplained the fact
that one of the indifferent impressions of the day- indeed, even of the
previous day- constantly makes a contribution to the dream-content. The
relations between this impression and the real source of the dream in the
unconscious do not always exist from the outset; as we have seen, they
are established subsequently, while the dream is actually at work, as though
to serve the purpose of the intended displacement. Something, therefore,
must necessitate the opening up of connections in the direction of the
recent but indifferent impression; this impression must possess some quality
that gives it a special fitness. Otherwise it would be just as easy for
the dream- thoughts to shift their accentuation to some inessential component
of their own sphere of ideas.

<P>&nbsp;Experiences such as the following show us the way to an explanation:
If the day has brought us two or more experiences which are worthy to evoke
a dream, the dream will blend the allusion of both into a single whole:
it obeys a compulsion to make them into a single whole. For example: One
summer afternoon I entered a railway carriage in which I found two acquaintances
of mine who were unknown to one another. One of them was an influential
colleague, the other a member of a distinguished family which I had been
attending in my professional capacity. I introduced the two gentlemen to
each other; but during the long journey they conversed with each other
through me, so that I had to discuss this or that topic now with one, now
with the other. I asked my colleague to recommend a mutual acquaintance
who had just begun to practise as a physician. He replied that he was convinced
of the young man's ability, but that his undistinguished appearance would
make it difficult for him to obtain patients in the upper ranks of society.
To this I rejoined: "That is precisely why he needs recommendation." A
little later, turning to my other fellow-traveller, I inquired after the
health of his aunt- the mother of one of my patients- who was at this time
prostrated by a serious illness. On the night following this journey I
dreamt that the young friend whom I had asked one of my companions to recommend
was in a fashionable drawing-room, and with all the bearing of a man of
the world was making- before a distinguished company, in which I recognized
all the rich and aristocratic persons of my acquaintance- a funeral oration
over the old lady (who in my dream had already died) who was the aunt of
my second fellow- traveller. (I confess frankly that I had not been on
good terms with this lady.) Thus my dream had once more found the connection
between the two impressions of the day, and by means of the two had constructed
a unified situation.

<P>&nbsp;In view of many similar experiences, I am persuaded to advance
the proposition that a dream works under a kind of compulsion which forces
it to combine into a unified whole all the sources of dream-stimulation
which are offered to it. * In a subsequent chapter (on the function of
dreams) we shall consider this impulse of combination as part of the process
of condensation, another primary psychic process.

<P>* The tendency of the dream at work to blend everything present of interest
into a single transaction has already been noticed by several authors,
for instance, by Delage and Delboeuf.

<P>I shall now consider the question whether the dream-exciting source
to which our analysis leads us must always be a recent (and significant)
event, or whether a subjective experience- that is to say, the recollection
of a psychologically significant event, a train of thought- may assume
the role of a dream- stimulus. The very definite answer, derived from numerous
analyses, is as follows: The stimulus of the dream may be a subjective
transaction, which has been made recent, as it were, by the mental activity
of the day.

<P>&nbsp;And this is perhaps the best time to summarize in schematic form
the different conditions under which the dream-sources are operative.

<P>&nbsp;The source of a dream may be:

<P>&nbsp;(a) A recent and psychologically significant event which is directly
represented in the dream. *

<P>&nbsp;(b) Several recent and significant events, which are combined
by the dream in a single whole. *(2)

<P>&nbsp;(c) One or more recent and significant events, which are represented
in the dream-content by allusion to a contemporary but indifferent event.

<P>&nbsp;(d) A subjectively significant experience (recollection, train
of thought), which is constantly represented in the dream by allusion to
a recent but indifferent impression. *(4)

<P>* The dream of Irma's injection; the dream of the friend who is my uncle.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) The dream of the funeral oration delivered by the young physician.

<P>&nbsp;*(3) The dream of the botanical monograph.

<P>&nbsp;*(4) The dreams of my patients during analysis are mostly of this
kind.

<P>As may be seen, in dream-interpretation the condition is always fulfilled
that one component of the dream-content repeats a recent impression of
the day of the dream. The component which is destined to be represented
in the dream may either belong to the same circle of ideas as the dream-stimulus
itself (as an essential or even an inessential element of the same); or
it may originate in the neighbourhood of an indifferent impression, which
has been brought by more or less abundant associations into relation with
the sphere of the dream-stimulus. The apparent multiplicity of these conditions
results merely from the alternative, that a displacement has or has not
occurred, and it may here be noted that this alternative enables us to
explain the contrasts of the dream quite as readily as the medical theory
of the dream explains the series of states from the partial to the complete
waking of the brain cells.

<P>&nbsp;In considering this series of sources we note further that the
psychologically significant but not recent element (a train of thought,
a recollection) may be replaced for the purposes of dream-formation by
a recent but psychologically indifferent element, provided the two following
conditions are fulfilled: (1) the dream-content preserves a connection
with things recently experienced; (2) the dream-stimulus is still a psychologically
significant event. In one single case (a) both these conditions are fulfilled
by the same impression. If we now consider that these same indifferent
impressions, which are utilized for the dream as long as they are recent,
lose this qualification as soon as they are a day (or at most several days)
older, we are obliged to assume that the very freshness of an impression
gives it a certain psychological value for dream-formation, somewhat equivalent
to the value of emotionally accentuated memories or trains of thought.
Later on, in the light of certain Psychological considerations, we shall
be able to divine the explanation of this importance of recent impressions
in dream formation. *

<P>* Cf. Chap. VII on "transference."

<P>Incidentally our attention is here called to the fact that at night,
and unnoticed by our consciousness, important changes may occur in the
material comprised by our ideas and memories. The injunction that before
making a final decision in any matter one should sleep on it for a night
is obviously fully justified. But at this point we find that we have passed
from the psychology of dreaming to the psychology of sleep, a step which
there will often be occasion to take.

<P>&nbsp;At this point there arises an objection which threatens to invalidate
the conclusions at which we have just arrived. If indifferent impressions
can find their way into the dream only so long as they are of recent origin,
how does it happen that in the dream-content we find elements also from
earlier periods of our lives, which, at the time when they were still recent,
possessed, as Strumpell puts it, no psychic value, and which, therefore,
ought to have been forgotten long ago; elements, that is, which are neither
fresh nor psychologically significant?

<P>&nbsp;This objection can be disposed of completely if we have recourse
to the results of the psychoanalysis of neurotics. The solution is as follows:
The process of shifting and rearrangement which replaces material of psychic
significance by material which is indifferent (whether one is dreaming
or thinking) has already taken place in these earlier periods of life,
and has since become fixed in the memory. Those elements which were originally
indifferent are in fact no longer so, since they have acquired the value
of psychologically significant material. That which has actually remained
indifferent can never be reproduced in the dream.

<P>&nbsp;From the foregoing exposition the reader may rightly conclude
that I assert that there are no indifferent dream-stimuli, and therefore
no guileless dreams. This I absolutely and unconditionally believe to be
the case, apart from the dreams of children, and perhaps the brief dream-reactions
to nocturnal sensations. Apart from these exceptions, whatever one dreams
is either plainly recognizable as being psychically significant, or it
is distorted and can be judged correctly only after complete interpretation,
when it proves, after all, to be of psychic significance. The dream never
concerns itself with trifles; we do not allow sleep to be disturbed by
trivialities. * Dreams which are apparently guileless turn out to be the
reverse of innocent, if one takes the trouble to interpret them; if I may
be permitted the expression, they ail show "the mark of the beast." Since
this is another point on which I may expect contradiction, and since I
am glad of an opportunity to show dream-distortion at work, I shall here
subject to analysis a number of guileless dreams from my collection.

<P>* Havelock Ellis, a kindly critic of The Interpretation of Dreams, writes
in The World of Dreams (p. 169): "From this point on, not many of us will
be able to follow F." But Mr. Ellis has not undertaken any analyses of
dreams, and will not believe how unjustifiable it is to judge them by the
manifest dream-content. -

I.</H3>
An intelligent and refined young woman, who in real life is distinctly
reserved, one of those people of whom one says that "still waters run deep,"
relates the following dream: "I dreamt that I arrived at the market too
late, and could get nothing from either the butcher or the greengrocer
woman." Surely a guileless dream, but as it has not the appearance of a
real dream I induce her to relate it in detail. Her report then runs as
follows: She goes to the market with her cook, who carries the basket.
The butcher tells her, after she has asked him for something: "That is
no longer to be obtained," and waits to give her something else, with the
remark: "That is good, too." She refuses, and goes to the greengrocer woman.
The latter tries to sell her a peculiar vegetable, which is bound up in
bundles, and is black in colour. She says: "I don't know that, I won't
take it."

<P>&nbsp;The connection of the dream with the preceding day is simple enough.
She had really gone to the market too late, and had been unable to buy
anything. The meatshop was already closed, comes into one's mind as a description
of the experience. But wait, is not that a very vulgar phrase which- or
rather, the opposite of which- denotes a certain neglect with regard to
man's clothing? The dreamer has not used these words; she has perhaps avoided
them: but let us look for the interpretation of the details contained in
the dream.

<P>&nbsp;When in a dream something has the character of a spoken utterance-
that is, when it is said or heard, not merely thought, and the distinction
can usually be made with certainty- then it originates in the utterances
of waking life, which have, of course, been treated as raw material, dismembered,
and slightly altered, and above all removed from their context. * In the
work of interpretation we may take such utterances as our starting- point.
Where, then, does the butcher's statement, That is no longer to be obtained,
come from? From myself; I had explained to her some days previously "that
the oldest experiences of childhood are no longer to be obtained as such,
but will be replaced in the analysis by transferences and dreams." Thus,
I am the butcher, and she refuses to accept these transferences to the
present of old ways of thinking and feeling. Where does her dream utterance,
I don't know that, I won't take it, come from? For the purposes of the
analysis this has to be dissected. I don't know that she herself had said
to her cook, with whom she had a dispute on the previous day, but she had
then added: Behave yourself decently. Here a displacement is palpable;
of the two sentences which she spoke to her cook, she included the insignificant
one in her dream; but the suppressed sentence, Behave yourself decently!
alone fits in with the rest of the dream-content. One might use the words
to a man who was making indecent overtures, and had neglected "to close
his meat-shop." That we have really hit upon the trail of the interpretation
is proved by its agreement with the allusions made by the incident with
the greengrocer woman. A vegetable which is sold tied up in bundles (a
longish vegetable, as she subsequently adds), and is also black: what can
this be but a dream-combination of asparagus and black radish? I need not
interpret asparagus to the initiated; and the other vegetable, too (think
of the exclamation: "Blacky, save yourself!"), seems to me to point to
the sexual theme at which we guessed in the beginning, when we wanted to
replace the story of the dream by "the meat-shop is closed." We are not
here concerned with the full meaning of the dream; so much is certain,
that it is full of meaning and by no means guileless. *(2)

<P>* Cf. what is said of speech in dreams in the chapter on "The Dream-Work."
Only one of the writers on the subject- Delboeuf- seems to have recognized
the origin of the speeches heard in dreams; he compares them with cliches.

<P>&nbsp;*(2) For the curious, I may remark that behind the dream there
is hidden a phantasy of indecent, sexually provoking conduct on my part,
and of repulsion on the part of the lady. If this interpretation should
seem preposterous, I would remind the reader of the numerous cases in which
physicians have been made the object of such charges by hysterical women,
with whom the same phantasy has not appeared in a distorted form as a dream,
but has become undisguisedly conscious and delusional. With this dream
the patient began her psycho-analytical treatment. It was only later that
I learned that with this dream she repeated the initial trauma in which
her neurosis originated, and since then I have noticed the same behaviour
in other persons who in their childhood were victims of sexual attacks,
and now, as it were, wish in their dreams for them to be repeated.
<H3>
II.</H3>
Another guileless dream of the same patient, which in some respects is
a pendant to the above. Her husband asks her: "Oughtn't we to have the
piano tuned?" She replies: "It's not worth while, the hammers would have
to be rebuffed as well." Again we have the reproduction of an actual event
of the preceding day. Her husband had asked her such a question, and she
had answered it in such words. But what is the meaning of her dreaming
it? She says of the piano that it is a disgusting old box which has a bad
tone; it belonged to her husband before they were married, * etc., but
the key to the true solution lies in the phrase: It isn't worth while.
This has its origin in a call paid yesterday to a woman friend. She was
asked to take off her coat, but declined, saying: "Thanks, it isn't worth
while, I must go in a moment." At this point I recall that yesterday, during
the analysis, she suddenly took hold of her coat, of which a button had
come undone. It was as though she meant to say: "Please don't look in,
it isn't worth while." Thus box becomes chest, and the interpretation of
the dream leads to the years when she was growing out of her childhood,
when she began to be dissatisfied with her figure. It leads us back, indeed,
to earlier periods, if we take into consideration the disgusting and the
bad tone, and remember how often in allusions and in dreams the two small
hemispheres of the female body take the place- as a substitute and an antithesis-
of the large ones.

<P>* A substitution by the opposite, as will be clear after analysis.
<H3>
III.</H3>
I will interrupt the analysis of this dreamer in order to insert a short,
innocent dream which was dreamed by a young man. He dreamt that he was
putting on his winter overcoat again; this was terrible. The occasion for
this dream is apparently the sudden advent of cold weather. On more careful
examination we note that the two brief fragments of the dream do not fit
together very well, for what could be terrible about wearing a thick or
heavy coat in cold weather? Unfortunately for the innocency of this dream,
the first association, under analysis, yields the recollection that yesterday
a lady had confidentially confessed to him that her last child owed its
existence to the splitting of a condom. He now reconstructs his thoughts
in accordance with this suggestion: A thin condom is dangerous, a thick
one is bad. The condom is a "pullover" (Ueberzieher = literally pullover),
for it is pulled over something: and Uebersieher is the German term for
a light overcoat. An experience like that related by the lady would indeed
be terrible for an unmarried man.

<P>&nbsp;We will now return to our other innocent dreamer.
<H3>
IV.</H3>
She puts a candle into a candlestick; but the candle is broken, so that
it does not stand up. The girls at school say she is clumsy; but she replies
that it is not her fault.

<P>&nbsp;Here, too, there is an actual occasion for the dream; the day
before she had actually put a candle into a candlestick; but this one was
not broken. An obvious symbolism has here been employed. The candle is
an object which excites the female genitals; its being broken, so that
it does not stand upright, signifies impotence on the man's part (it is
not her fault). But does this young woman, carefully brought up, and a
stranger to all obscenity, know of such an application of the candle? By
chance she is able to tell how she came by this information. While paddling
a canoe on the Rhine, a boat passed her which contained some students,
who were singing rapturously, or rather yelling: "When the Queen of Sweden,
behind closed shutters, with the candles of Apollo..."

<P>&nbsp;She does not hear or else understand the last word. Her husband
was asked to give her the required explanation. These verses are then replaced
in the dream-content by the innocent recollection of a task which she once
performed clumsily at her boarding- school, because of the closed shutters.
The connection between the theme of masturbation and that of impotence
is clear enough. Apollo in the latent dream-content connects this dream
with an earlier one in which the virgin Pallas figured. All this is obviously
not innocent.
<H3>
V.</H3>
Lest it may seem too easy a matter to draw conclusions from dreams concerning
the dreamer's real circumstances, I add another dream originating with
the same person, which once more appears innocent. "I dreamt of doing something,"
she relates, "which I actually did during the day, that is to say, I filled
a little trunk so full of books that I had difficulty in closing it. My
dream was just like the actual occurrence." Here the dreamer herself emphasizes
the correspondence between the dream and the reality. All such criticisms
of the dream, and comments on the dream, although they have found a place
in the waking thoughts, properly belong to the latent dream-content, as
further examples will confirm. We are told, then, that what the dream relates
has actually occurred during the day. It would take us too far afield to
show how we arrive at the idea of making use of the English language to
help us in the interpretation of this dream. Suffice it to say that it
is again a question of a little box (cf. chap. IV, the dream of the dead
child in the box) which has been filled so full that nothing can go into
it.

<P>&nbsp;In all these "innocent" dreams the sexual factor as the motive
of the censorship is very prominent. But this is a subject of primary significance,
which we must consider later.
