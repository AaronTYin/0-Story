F. The Ethical Sense in Dreams</H2>
For reasons which will be intelligible only after a consideration of my
own investigations of dreams, I have isolated from the psychology of the
dream the subsidiary problem as to whether and to what extent the moral
dispositions and feelings of waking life extend into dream-life. The same
contradictions which we were surprised to observe in the descriptions by
various authors of all the other psychic activities will surprise us again
here. Some writers flatly assert that dreams know nothing of moral obligations;
others as decidedly declare that the moral nature of man persists even
in his dream-life.

<P>Our ordinary experience of dreams seems to confirm beyond all doubt
the correctness of the first assertion. Jessen says (p. 553): "Nor does
one become better or more virtuous during sleep; on the contrary, it seems
that conscience is silent in our dreams, inasmuch as one feels no compassion
and can commit the worst crimes, such as theft, murder, and homicide, with
perfect indifference and without subsequent remorse."

<P>Radestock (p. 146) says: "It is to be noted that in dreams associations
are effected and ideas combined without being in any way influenced by
reflection, reason, aesthetic taste, and moral judgment; the judgment is
extremely weak, and ethical indifference reigns supreme."

<P>Volkelt (p. 23) expresses himself as follows: "As every one knows, dreams
are especially unbridled in sexual matters. Just as the dreamer himself
is shameless in the extreme, and wholly lacking in moral feeling and judgment,
so likewise does he see others, even the most respected persons, doing
things which, even in his thoughts, he would blush to associate with them
in his waking state."

<P>Utterances like those of Schopenhauer, that in dreams every man acts
and talks in complete accordance with his character, are in sharpest contradiction
to those mentioned above. R. Ph. Fischer * maintains that the subjective
feelings and desires, or affects and passions, manifest themselves in the
wilfulness of the dream-life, and that the moral characteristics of a man
are mirrored in his dreams.

<P>* Grundzuge des Systems der Anthropologie. Erlangen, 1850 (quoted by
Spitta).

<P>Haffner says (p. 25): "With rare exceptions... a virtuous man will be
virtuous also in his dreams; he will resist temptation, and show no sympathy
for hatred, envy, anger, and all other vices; whereas the sinful man will,
as a rule, encounter in his dreams the images which he has before him in
the waking state."

<P>Scholz (p. 36): "In dreams there is truth; despite all camouflage of
nobility or degradation, we recognize our own true selves.... The honest
man does not commit a dishonouring crime even in his dreams, or, if he
does, he is appalled by it as by something foreign to his nature. The Roman
emperor who ordered one of his subjects to be executed because he dreamed
that he had cut off the emperor's head was not far wrong in justifying
his action on the ground that he who has such dreams must have similar
thoughts while awake. Significantly enough, we say of things that find
no place even in our intimate thoughts: 'I would never even dream of such
a thing.'"

<P>Plato, on the other hand, considers that they are the best men who only
dream the things which other men do.

<P>Plaff, * varying a familiar proverb, says: "Tell me your dreams for
a time and I will tell you what you are within."

<P>* Das Traumleben und seine Deutung, 1868 (cited by Spitta, p. 192).

<P>The little essay of Hildebrandt's from which I have already taken so
many quotations (the best-expressed and most suggestive contribution to
the literature of the dream-problem which I have hitherto discovered),
takes for its central theme the problem of morality in dreams. For Hildebrandt,
too, it is an established rule that the purer the life, the purer the dream;
the impurer the life, the impurer the dream.

<P>The moral nature of man persists even in dreams. "But while we are not
offended or made suspicious by an arithmetical error, no matter how obvious,
by a reversal of scientific fact, no matter how romantic, or by an anachronism,
no matter how ridiculous, we nevertheless do not lose sight of the difference
between good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice. No matter how
much of that which accompanies us during the day may vanish in our hours
of sleep, Kant's categorical imperative dogs our steps as an inseparable
companion, of whom we cannot rid ourselves even in our slumber.... This
can be explained only by the fact that the fundamental element of human
nature, the moral essence, is too firmly fixed to be subjected to the kaleidoscopic
shaking-up to which phantasy, reason, memory, and other faculties of the
same order succumb in our dreams" (p. 45, etc.).

<P>In the further discussion of the subject we find in both these groups
of authors remarkable evasions and inconsequences. Strictly speaking, all
interest in immoral dreams should be at an end for those who assert that
the moral personality of the individual falls to pieces in his dreams.
They could as coolly reject all attempts to hold the dreamer responsible
for his dreams, or to infer from the immorality of his dreams that there
is an immoral strain in his nature, as they have rejected the apparently
analogous attempt to prove from the absurdity of his dreams the worthlessness
of his intellectual life in the waking state. The others, according to
whom the categorical imperative extends even into the dream, ought to accept
in toto the notion of full responsibility for immoral dreams; and we can
only hope that their own reprehensible dreams do not lead them to abandon
their otherwise firm belief in their own moral worth.

<P>As a matter of fact, however, it would seem that although no one is
positively certain just how good or how bad he is, he can hardly deny that
he can recollect immoral dreams of his own. That there are such dreams
no one denies; the only question is: how do they originate? So that, in
spite of their conflicting judgments of dream-morality, both groups of
authors are at pains to explain the genesis of the immoral dream; and here
a new conflict arises, as to whether its origin is to be sought in the
normal functions of the psychic life, or in the somatically conditioned
encroachments upon this life. The nature of the facts compels both those
who argue for and those who argue against moral responsibility in dream-life
to agree in recognizing a special psychic source for the immorality of
dreams.

<P>Those who maintain that morality continues to function in our dream-life
nevertheless refrain from assuming full responsibility for their dreams.
Haffner says (p. 24): "We are not responsible for our dreams, because that
basis which alone gives our life truth and reality is withdrawn from our
thoughts and our will. Hence the wishes and actions of our dreams cannot
be virtuous or sinful." Yet the dreamer is responsible for the sinful dream
in so far as indirectly he brings it about. Thus, as in waking life, it
is his duty, just before going to sleep, morally to cleanse his mind.

<P>The analysis of this admixture of denial and recognition of responsibility
for the moral content of dreams is carried much further by Hildebrandt.
After arguing that the dramatic method of representation characteristic
of dreams, the condensation of the most complicated processes of reflection
into the briefest periods of time, and the debasement and confusion of
the imaginative elements of dreams, which even he admits must be allowed
for in respect of the immoral appearance of dreams, he nevertheless confesses
that there are the most serious objections to flatly denying all responsibility
for the lapses and offenses of which we are guilty in our dreams.

<P>(p. 49): "If we wish to repudiate very decisively any sort of unjust
accusation, and especially one which has reference to our intentions and
convictions, we use the expression: 'We should never have dreamt of such
a thing.' By this, it is true, we mean on the one hand that we consider
the region of dreams the last and remotest place in which we could be held
responsible for our thoughts, because there these thoughts are so loosely
and incoherently connected with our real being that we can, after all,
hardly regard them as our own; but inasmuch as we feel impelled expressly
to deny the existence of such thoughts even in this region, we are at the
same time indirectly admitting that our justification would not be complete
unless it extended even thus far. And I believe that here, although unconsciously,
we are speaking the language of truth."

<P>(p. 52): "No dream-action can be imagined whose first beginnings have
not in some shape already passed through the mind during our waking hours,
in the form of wish, desire, or impulse." Concerning this original impulse
we must say: The dream has not discovered it- it has only imitated and
extended it; it has only elaborated into dramatic form a scrap of historical
material which it found already existing within us; it brings to our mind
the words of the Apostle that he who hates his brother is a murderer. And
though, after we wake, being conscious of our moral strength, we may smile
at the whole widely elaborated structure of the depraved dream, yet the
original material out of which we formed it cannot be laughed away. One
feels responsible for the transgressions of one's dreaming self; not for
the whole sum of them, but yet for a certain percentage. "In short, if
in this sense, which can hardly be impugned, we understand the words of
Christ, that out of the heart come evil thoughts, then we can hardly help
being convinced that every sin committed in our dreams brings with it at
least a vague minimum of guilt."

<P>Thus Hildebrandt finds the source of the immorality of dreams in the
germs and hints of evil impulses which pass through our minds during the
day as mental temptations, and he does not hesitate to include these immoral
elements in the ethical evaluation of the personality. These same thoughts,
and the same evaluation of these thoughts, have, as we know, caused devout
and holy men of all ages to lament that they were wicked sinners. *

<P>* It is not uninteresting to consider the attitude of the Inquisition
to this problem. In the Tractatus de Officio sanctissimae Inquisitionis
of Thomas Carena (Lyons edit., 1659) one finds the following passage: "Should
anyone utter heresies in his dreams, the inquisitors shall consider this
a reason for investigating his conduct in life, for that is wont to return
in sleep which occupies a man during the day" (Dr. Ehniger, St. Urban,
Switzerland).

<P>The general occurrence of these contrasting thoughts in the majority
of men, and even in other regions than the ethical, is of course established
beyond a doubt. They have sometimes been judged in a less serious spirit.
Spitta quotes a relevant passage from A. Zeller (Article "Irre," in the
Allgemeine Encyklopadie der Wissenschaften, Ersch and Gruber, p. 144):
"An intellect is rarely so happily organized as to be in full command of
itself at all times and seasons, and never to be disturbed in the lucid
and constant processes of thought by ideas not merely unessential, but
absolutely grotesque and nonsensical; indeed, the greatest thinkers have
had cause to complain of this dream-like, tormenting and distressing rabble
of ideas, which disturbs their profoundest contemplations and their most
pious and earnest meditations."

<P>A clearer light is thrown on the psychological meaning of these contrasting
thoughts by a further observation of Hildebrandt's, to the effect that
dreams permit us an occasional glimpse of the deepest and innermost recesses
of our being, which are generally closed to us in our waking state (p.
55). A recognition of this fact is betrayed by Kant in his Anthropology,
when he states that our dreams may perhaps be intended to reveal to us
not what we are but what we might have been if we had had another upbringing;
and by Radestock (p. 84), who suggests that dreams disclose to us what
we do not wish to admit to ourselves, and that we therefore unjustly condemn
them as lying and deceptive. J. E. Erdmann asserts: "A dream has never
told me what I ought to think of a person, but, to my great surprise, a
dream has more than once taught me what I do really think of him and feel
about him." And J. H. Fichte expresses himself in a like manner: "The character
of our dreams gives a far truer reflection of our general disposition than
anything that we can learn by self-observation in the waking state." Such
remarks as this of Benini's call our attention to the fact that the emergence
of impulses which are foreign to our ethical consciousness is merely analogous
to the manner, already familiar to us, in which the dream disposes of other
representative material: "Certe nostre inclinazioni che si credevano soffocate
e spente da un pezzo, si ridestano; passioni vecchie e sepolte revivono;
cose e persone a cui non pensiamo mai, ci vengono dinanzi" (p. 149). Volkelt
expresses himself in a similar fashion: "Even ideas which have entered
into our consciousness almost unnoticed, and which, perhaps, it has never
before called out of oblivion, often announce their presence in the mind
through a dream" (p 105). Finally, we may remember that according to Schleiermacher
the state of falling asleep is accompanied by the appearance of undesired
imaginings.

<P>We may include in such "undesired imaginings" the whole of that imaginative
material the occurrence of which surprises us in immoral as well as in
absurd dreams. The only important difference consists in the fact that
the undesired imaginings in the moral sphere are in opposition to our usual
feelings, whereas the others merely appear strange to us. So far nothing
has been done to enable us to reconcile this difference by a profounder
understanding. But what is the significance of the emergence of undesired
representations in dreams? What conclusions can the psychology of the waking
and dreaming mind draw from these nocturnal manifestations of contrasting
ethical impulses? Here we find a fresh diversity of opinion, and also a
different grouping of the authors who have treated of the subject. The
line of thought followed by Hildebrandt, and by others who share his fundamental
opinion, cannot be continued otherwise than by ascribing to the immoral
impulses, even in the waking state, a latent vitality, which is indeed
inhibited from proceeding to action, and by asserting that during sleep
something falls away from us which, having the effect of an inhibition,
has kept us from becoming aware of the existence of such impulses. Dreams
therefore, reveal the true, if not the whole, nature of the dreamer, and
are one means of making the hidden life of the psyche accessible to our
understanding. It is only on such hypotheses that Hildebrandt can attribute
to the dream the role of a monitor who calls our attention to the secret
mischief in the soul, just as, according to the physicians, it may announce
a hitherto unobserved physical disorder. Spitta, too, must be influenced
by this conception when he refers, for example, to the stream of excitations
which flow in upon the psyche during puberty, and consoles the dreamer
by assuring him that he has done all that is in his power to do if he has
led a strictly virtuous life during his waking state, if he has made an
effort to suppress the sinful thoughts as often as they arise, and has
kept them from maturing and turning into action. According to this conception,
we might designate as "undesired imaginings" those that are suppressed
during the day, and we must recognize in their emergence a genuine psychic
phenomenon.

<P>According to certain other authors, we have no right to draw this last
inference. For Jessen (p. 360) the undesired ideas and images, in the dream
as in the waking state, and also in the delirium of fever, etc., possess
"the character of a voluntary activity laid to rest, and of a procession,
to some extent mechanical, of images and ideas evoked by inner impulses."
An immoral dream proves nothing in respect of the psychic life of the dreamer
except that he has somehow become cognizant of the imaginative content
in question; it is certainly no proof of a psychic impulse of his own mind.
Another writer, Maury, makes us wonder whether he, too, does not ascribe
to the dream-state the power of dividing the psychic activity into its
components, instead of aimlessly destroying it. He speaks as follows of
dreams in which one oversteps the bounds of morality: "Ce sont nos penchants
qui parlent et qui nous font agir, sans que la conscience nous retienne,
bien que parfois elle nous avertisse. J'ai mes defauts et mes penchants
vicieux; a l'etat de veille, je tache de lutter contre eux, et il m'arrive
assez souvent de n'y pas succomber. Mais dans mes songes j'y succombe toujours,
ou pour mieux dire j'agis par leur impulsion, sans crainte et sans remords....
Evidemment les visions qui se deroulent devant ma pensee, et qui constituent
le reve, me sont suggerees par les incitations que je ressens et que ma
volonte absente ne cherche pas a refouler."- * Le Sommeil (p. 113).

<P>* Our tendencies speak and make us act, without being restrained by
our conscience, although it sometimes warns us. I have my faults and vicious
tendencies; awake I try to fight against them, and often enough I do not
succumb to them. But in my dreams I always succumb, or, rather, I act at
their direction, without fear or remorse.... Evidently, the visions which
unfold in my thoughts, and which constitute the dream, are suggested by
the stimuli which I feel and which my absent will does not try to repel.

<P>If one believed in the power of the dream to reveal an actually existing,
but suppressed or concealed, immoral disposition of the dreamer, one could
not express one's opinion more emphatically than in the words of Maury
(p. 115): "En reve l'homme se revele donc tout entier a soi-meme dans sa
nudite et sa misere natives. Des qu'il suspend l'exercise de sa volonte,
il devient le jouet de toutes les passions contre lesquelles, a l'etat
de veille, la conscience, le sentiment d'honneur, la crainte nous defendent."
* In another place makes the striking assertion (p. 462): "Dans le reve,
c'est surtout l'homme instinctif que se revele.... L'homme revient pour
ainsi dire l'etat de nature quand il reve; mais moins les idees acquises
ont penetre dans son esprit, plus 'les penchants en desaccord' avec elles
conservent encore sur lui d'influence dans le rive." *(2) He then mentions,
as an example, that his own dreams often reveal him as a victim of just
those superstitions which he has most vigorously attacked in his writings.

<P>* In a dream, a man is totally revealed to himself in his naked and
wretched state. As he suspends the exercise of his will, he becomes the
toy of all the passions from which, when awake, our conscience, horror,
and fear defend us.

<P>*(2) In a dream, it is above all the instinctive man who is revealed....
Man returns, so to speak, to the natural state when he dreams; but the
less acquired ideas have penetrated into his mind, the more his "tendencies
to disagreement" with them keep their hold on him in his dreams.

<P>The value of all these acute observations is, however, impaired in Maury's
case, because he refuses to recognize in the phenomena which he has so
accurately observed anything more than a proof of the automatisme psychologique
which in his own opinion dominates the dream-life. He conceives this automatism
as the complete opposite of psychic activity.

<P>A passage in Stricker's Studien uber das Bewusstsein reads: "Dreams
do not consist purely and simply of delusions; for example, if one is afraid
of robbers in a dream, the robbers indeed are imaginary, but the fear is
real." Our attention is here called to the fact that the affective development
of a dream does not admit of the judgment which one bestows upon the rest
of the dream-content, and the problem then arises: What part of the psychic
processes in a dream may be real? That is to say, what part of them may
claim to be enrolled among the psychic processes of the waking state?
