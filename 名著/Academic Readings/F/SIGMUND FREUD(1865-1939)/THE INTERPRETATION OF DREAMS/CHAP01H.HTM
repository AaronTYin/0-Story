H. The Relation between Dreams and Mental Diseases</H2>
When we speak of the relation of dreams to mental derangement, we may mean
three different things: (1) aetiological and clinical relations, as when
a dream represents or initiates a psychotic condition, or occurs subsequently
to such a condition; (2) changes which the dream-life undergoes in cases
of mental disease; (3) inner relations between dreams and psychoses, analogies
which point to an intimate relationship. These manifold relations between
the two series of phenomena were in the early days of medical science-
and are once more at the present time- a favourite theme of medical writers,
as we may learn from the literature on the subject collated by Spitta,
Radestock, Maury, and Tissie. Recently Sante de Sanctis has directed his
attention to this relationship. * For the purposes of our discussion it
will suffice merely to glance at this important subject.

<P>* Among the more recent authors who have occupied themselves with these
relations are: Fere, Ideler, Lasegue, Pichon, Regis Vespa, Giessler, Kazodowsky,
Pachantoni, and others.

<P>As to the clinical and aetiological relations between dreams and the
psychoses, I will report the following observations as examples: Hohnbaum
asserts (see Krauss) that the first attack of insanity is frequently connected
with a terrifying anxiety-dream, and that the predominating idea is related
to this dream. Sante de Sanctis adduces similar observations in respect
of paranoiacs, and declares the dream to be, in some of them, "la vraie
cause determinante de la folie." * The psychosis may come to life quite
suddenly, simultaneously with the dream that contains its effective and
delusive explanation, or it may develop slowly through subsequent dreams
that have still to struggle against doubt. In one of de Sanctis's cases
an intensively moving dream was accompanied by slight hysterical attacks,
which, in their turn, were followed by an anxious melancholic state. Fere
(cited by Tissie) refers to a dream which was followed by hysterical paralysis.
Here the dream is presented as the aetiology of mental derangement, although
we should be making a statement equally consistent with the facts were
we to say that the first manifestation of the mental derangement occurred
in the dream-life, that the disorder first broke through in the dream.
In other instances, the morbid symptoms are included in the dream-life,
or the psychosis remains confined to the dream-life. Thus Thomayer calls
our attention to anxiety-dreams which must be conceived as the equivalent
of epileptic attacks. Allison has described cases of nocturnal insanity
(see Radestock), in which the subjects are apparently perfectly well in
the day-time, while hallucinations, fits of frenzy, and the like regularly
make their appearance at night. De Sanctis and Tissie record similar observations
(the equivalent of a paranoic dream in an alcoholic, voices accusing a
wife of infidelity). Tissie records many observations of recent date in
which behaviour of a pathological character (based on delusory hypotheses,
obsessive impulses) had their origin in dreams. Guislain describes a case
in which sleep was replaced by an intermittent insanity.

<P>* The real determining cause of the madness.

<P>We cannot doubt that one day the physician will concern himself not
only with the psychology, but also with the psycho-pathology of dreams.

<P>In cases of convalescence from insanity, it is often especially obvious
that while the functions may be healthy by day the dream-life may still
partake of the psychosis. Gregory is said to have been the first to call
attention to such cases (see Krauss). Macario (cited by Tissie) gives an
account of a maniac who, a week after his complete recovery, once more
experienced in dreams the flux of ideas and the unbridled impulses of his
disease.

<P>Concerning the changes which the dream-life undergoes in chronic psychotics,
little research has been undertaken as yet. On the other hand, early attention
was given to the inner relationship between dreams and mental disturbances,
a relationship which is demonstrated by the complete agreement of the manifestations
occurring in each. According to Maury, Cabanis, in his Rapports du Physique
et du Moral, was the first to call attention to this relationship; he was
followed by Lelut, J. Moreau, and more particularly the philosopher Maine
de Biran. The comparison between the two is of course older still. Radestock
begins the chapter in which he deals with the subject by citing a number
of opinions which insist on the analogy between insanity and dreaming.
Kant says somewhere: "The lunatic is a dreamer in the waking state." According
to Krauss, "Insanity is a dream in which the senses are awake." Schopenhauer
terms the dream a brief insanity, and insanity a long dream. Hagen describes
delirium as a dream-life which is inducted not by sleep but by disease.
Wundt, in his Physiologische Psychologie, declares: "As a matter of fact
we ourselves may in dreams experience almost all the manifestations which
we observe in the asylums for the insane."

<P>The specific points of agreement in consequence of which such a comparison
commends itself to our judgment are enumerated by Spitta, who groups them
(very much as Maury has done) as follows: "(1) Suspension, or at least
retardation of self-consciousness, and consequently ignorance of the condition
as such, the impossibility of astonishment, and a lack of moral consciousness.
(2) Modified perception of the sensory organs; that is, perception is as
a rule diminished in dreams, and greatly enhanced in insanity. (3) Mutual
combination of ideas exclusively in accordance with the laws of association
and reproduction, hence automatic series-formations: hence again a lack
of proportion in the relations between ideas (exaggerations, phantasms);
and the results of all this: (4) Changes in- for example, inversions of-
the personality, and sometimes of the idiosyncrasies of the character (perversities)."

<P>Radestock adds a few additional data concerning the analogous nature
of the material of dreams and of mental derangement: "The greatest number
of hallucinations and illusions are found in the sphere of the senses of
sight and hearing and general sensation. As in dreams, the fewest elements
are supplied by the senses of smell and taste. The fever-patient, like
the dreamer, is assailed by reminiscences from the remote past; what the
waking and healthy man seems to have forgotten is recollected in sleep
and in disease." The analogy between dreams and the psychoses receives
its full value only when, like a family resemblance, it is extended to
the subtler points of mimicry, and even the individual peculiarities of
facial expression.

<P>"To him who is tortured by physical and mental sufferings the dream
accords what has been denied him by reality, to wit, physical well-being,
and happiness; so, too, the insane see radiant images of happiness, eminence,
and wealth. The supposed possession of estates and the imaginary fulfilment
of wishes, the denial or destruction of which have actually been a psychic
cause of the insanity, often form the main content of the delirium. The
woman who has lost a dearly beloved child experiences in her delirium the
joys of maternity; the man who has suffered reverses of fortune deems himself
immensely wealthy; and the jilted girl sees herself tenderly beloved."

<P>(This passage from Radestock is an abstract of a brilliant exposition
of Griesinger's (p. 111), which reveals, with the greatest clarity, wish-fulfilment
as a characteristic of the imagination common to dreams and to the psychoses.
My own investigations have taught me that here is to be found the key to
a psychological theory of dreams and of the psychoses.)

<P>"Absurd combinations of ideas and weakness of judgment are the main
characteristics of the dream and of insanity." The over-estimation of one's
own mental capacity, which appears absurd to sober judgment, is found alike
in both, and the rapid flux of imaginings in the dream corresponds to the
flux of ideas in the psychoses. Both are devoid of any measure of time.
The splitting of the personality in dreams, which, for instance, distributes
one's own knowledge between two persons, one of whom, the strange person,
corrects one's own ego in the dream, entirely corresponds with the well-known
splitting of the personality in hallucinatory paranoia; the dreamer, too,
hears his own thoughts expressed by strange voices. Even the constant delusive
ideas find their analogy in the stereotyped and recurring pathological
dream (reve obsedant). After recovering from delirium, patients not infrequently
declare that the whole period of their illness appeared to them like an
uncomfortable dream; indeed, they inform us that sometimes during their
illness they have suspected that they were only dreaming, just as often
happens in the sleep-dream.

<P>In view of all this, it is not surprising that Radestock should summarize
his own opinion, and that of many others, in the following words: "Insanity,
an abnormal morbid phenomenon, is to be regarded as an enhancement of the
periodically recurring normal dream-state" (p. 228).

<P>Krauss attempted to base the relationship between the dream and insanity
upon their aetiology (or rather upon the sources of excitation), thus,
perhaps, making the relationship even more intimate than was possible on
the basis of the analogous nature of the phenomena manifested. According
to him, the fundamental element common to both is, as we have already learned,
the organically conditioned sensation, the sensation of physical stimuli,
the general sensation arising out of contributions from all the organs
(cf. Peisse, cited by Maury, p. 52).

<P>The undeniable agreement between dreams and mental derangement, extending
even to characteristic details, constitutes one of the strongest confirmations
of the medical theory of dream-life, according to which the dream is represented
as a useless and disturbing process, and as the expression of a diminished
psychic activity. One cannot expect, for the present, to derive the final
explanation of the dream from the psychic derangements, since, as is well
known, our understanding of the origin of the latter is still highly unsatisfactory.
It is very probable, however, that a modified conception of the dream must
also influence our views regarding the inner mechanism of mental disorders,
and hence we may say that we are working towards the explanation of the
psychoses when we endeavour to elucidate the mystery of dreams.

ADDENDUM 1909</H2>
I shall have to justify myself for not extending my summary of the literature
of dream-problems to cover the period between the first appearance of this
book and the publication of the second edition. This justification may
not seem very satisfactory to the reader; none the less, to me it was decisive.
The motives which induced me to summarize the treatment of dreams in the
literature of the subject have been exhausted by the foregoing introduction;
to have continued this would have cost me a great deal of effort and would
not have been particularly useful or instructive. For the interval in question-
a period of nine years- has yielded nothing new or valuable as regards
the conception of dreams, either in actual material or in novel points
of view. In most of the literature which has appeared since the publication
of my own work the latter has not been mentioned or discussed; it has,
of course, received the least attention from the so-called "research-workers
on dreams," who have thus afforded a brilliant example of the aversion
to learning anything new so characteristic of the scientist. "Les savants
ne sont pas curieux," * said the scoffer Anatole France. If there were
such a thing in science as the right of revenge, I in my turn should be
justified in ignoring the literature which has appeared since the publication
of this book. The few reviews which have appeared in the scientific journals
are so full of misconceptions and lack of comprehension that my only possible
answer to my critics would be a request that they should read this book
over again- or perhaps merely that they should read it!

<P>* The learned are not inquisitive.

<P>In the works of those physicians who make use of the psycho-analytic
method of treatment a great many dreams have been recorded and interpreted
in accordance with my directions. In so far as these works go beyond the
confirmation of my own assertions, I have noted their results in the context
of my exposition. A supplementary bibliography at the end of this volume
comprises the most important of these new publications. The comprehensive
work on the dream by Sante de Sanctis, of which a German translation appeared
soon after its publication, was produced simultaneously with my own, so
that I could not review his results, nor could he comment upon mine. I
am sorry to have to express the opinion that this laborious work is exceedingly
poor in ideas, so poor that one could never divine from it the possibility
of the problems which I have treated in these pages.

<P>I can think of only two publications which touch on my own treatment
of the dream-problems. A young philosopher, H. Swoboda, who has ventured
to extend W. Fliess's discovery of biological periodicity (in series of
twenty-three and twenty-eight days) to the psychic field, has produced
an imaginative essay, * in which, among other things, he has used this
key to solve the riddle of dreams. Such a solution, however, would be an
inadequate estimate of the significance of dreams. The material content
of dreams would be explained by the coincidence of all those memories which,
on the night of the dream, complete one of these biological periods for
the first or the nth time. A personal communication of the author's led
me to assume that he himself no longer took this theory very seriously.
But it seems that I was mistaken in this conclusion: I shall record in
another place some observations made with reference to Swoboda's thesis,
which did not, however, yield convincing results. It gave me far greater
pleasure to find by chance, in an unexpected quarter, a conception of the
dream which is in complete agreement with the essence of my own. The relevant
dates preclude the possibility that this conception was influenced by reading
my book: I must therefore hail this as the only demonstrable concurrence
with the essentials of my theory of dreams to be found in the literature
of the subject. The book which contains the passage that I have in mind
was published (in its second edition) in 1910, by Lynkeus, under the title
Phantasien eines Realisten.

ADDENDUM 1914</H2>
The above apologia was written in 1909. Since then, the state of affairs
has certainly undergone a change; my contribution to the "interpretation
of dreams" is no longer ignored in the literature of the subject. But the
new situation makes it even more impossible to continue the foregoing summary.
The Interpretation of Dreams has evoked a whole series of new contentions
and problems, which have been expounded by the authors in the most varied
fashions. But I cannot discuss these works until I have developed the theories
to which their authors have referred. Whatever has appeared to me as valuable
in this recent literature I have accordingly reviewed in the course of
the following exposition.
