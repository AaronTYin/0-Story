<BLOCKQUOTE>I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. W. S. Dallas for this
Glossary, which has been given because several readers have complained

In the refraction of light by a convex lens the rays passing through different
parts of the lens are brought to a focus at slightly different distances,
this is called <I>spherical aberration</I>; at the same time the coloured
rays are separated by the prismatic action of the lens and likewise brought
to a focus at different distances, this is <I>chromatic aberration</I>.</DD>

In many of the lower animals (such as the Corals, Medus&aelig;, &amp;c.)

process of budding with or without separation from the parent of the product
of the latter, which is often very different from that of the egg. The
individuality of the species is represented by the whole of the form produced
between two sexual reproductions; and these forms, which are apparently
individual animals, have been called <I>zooids</I>.</DD>
