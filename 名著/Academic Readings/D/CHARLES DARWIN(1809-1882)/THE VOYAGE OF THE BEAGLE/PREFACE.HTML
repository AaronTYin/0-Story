Preface</H3>
I have stated in the preface to the first Edition of this work, and in
the Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle, that it was in consequence of
a wish expressed by Captain Fitz Roy, of having some scientific person
on board, accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own
accommodations, that I volunteered my services, which received, through
the kindness of the hydrographer, Captain Beaufort, the sanction of the
Lords of the Admiralty. As I feel that the opportunities which I enjoyed
of studying the Natural History of the different countries we visited,
have been wholly due to Captain Fitz Roy, I hope I may here be permitted
to repeat my expression of gratitude to him; and to add that, during the
five years we were together, I received from him the most cordial friendship
and steady assistance. Both to Captain Fitz Roy and to all the <A HREF="#note1">Officers
of the Beagle [note 1]</A> I shall ever feel most thankful for the undeviating
kindness with which I was treated during our long voyage.

<P>This volume contains, in the form of a Journal, a history of our voyage,
and a sketch of those observations in Natural History and Geology, which
I think will possess some interest for the general reader. I have in this
edition largely condensed and corrected some parts, and have added a little
to others, in order to render the volume more fitted for popular reading;
but I trust that naturalists will remember, that they must refer for details
to the larger publications which comprise the scientific results of the
Expedition. The Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle includes an account
of the Fossil Mammalia, by Professor Owen; of the Living Mammalia, by Mr.
Waterhouse; of the Birds, by Mr. Gould; of the Fish, by the Rev. L. Jenyns;
and of the Reptiles, by Mr. Bell. I have appended to the descriptions of
each species an account of its habits and range. These works, which I owe
to the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above distinguished authors,
could not have been undertaken, had it not been for the liberality of the
Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, who, through the representation
of the Right Honourable the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have been pleased
to grant a sum of one thousand pounds towards defraying part of the expenses
of publication.

<P>I have myself published separate volumes on the 'Structure and Distribution
of Coral Reefs;' on the 'Volcanic Islands visited during the Voyage of
the Beagle;' and on the 'Geology of South America.' The sixth volume of
the 'Geological Transactions' contains two papers of mine on the Erratic
Boulders and Volcanic Phenomena of South America. Messrs. Waterhouse, Walker,
Newman, and White, have published several able papers on the Insects which
were collected, and I trust that many others will hereafter follow. The
plants from the southern parts of America will be given by Dr. J. Hooker,
in his great work on the Botany of the Southern Hemisphere. The Flora of
the Galapagos Archipelago is the subject of a separate memoir by him, in
the 'Linnean Transactions.' The Reverend Professor Henslow has published
a list of the plants collected by me at the Keeling Islands; and the Reverend
J. M. Berkeley has described my cryptogamic plants.

<P>I shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance which
I have received from several other naturalists, in the course of this and
my other works; but I must be here allowed to return my most sincere thanks
to the Reverend Professor Henslow, who, when I was an undergraduate at
Cambridge, was one chief means of giving me a taste for Natural History,
-- who, during my absence, took charge of the collections I sent home,
and by his correspondence directed my endeavours, -- and who, since my
return, has constantly rendered me every assistance which the kindest friend
could offer.
