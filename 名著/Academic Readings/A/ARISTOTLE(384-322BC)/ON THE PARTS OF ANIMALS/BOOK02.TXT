  THE nature and the number of the parts of which animals are

severally composed are matters which have already been set forth in

detail in the book of Researches about Animals. We have now to inquire

what are the causes that in each case have determined this

composition, a subject quite distinct from that dealt with in the

Researches.

  Now there are three degrees of composition; and of these the first

in order, as all will allow, is composition out of what some call

the elements, such as earth, air, water, fire. Perhaps, however, it

would be more accurate to say composition out of the elementary

forces; nor indeed out of all of these, but out of a limited number of

them, as defined in previous treatises. For fluid and solid, hot and

cold, form the material of all composite bodies; and all other

differences are secondary to these, such differences, that is, as

heaviness or lightness, density or rarity, roughness or smoothness,

and any other such properties of matter as there may be. second degree

of composition is that by which the homogeneous parts of animals, such

as bone, flesh, and the like, are constituted out of the primary

substances. The third and last stage is the composition which forms

the heterogeneous parts, such as face, hand, and the rest.

  Now the order of actual development and the order of logical

existence are always the inverse of each other. For that which is

posterior in the order of development is antecedent in the order of

nature, and that is genetically last which in nature is first.

  (That this is so is manifest by induction; for a house does not

exist for the sake of bricks and stones, but these materials for the

sake of the house; and the same is the case with the materials of

other bodies. Nor is induction required to show this. it is included

in our conception of generation. For generation is a process from a

something to a something; that which is generated having a cause in

which it originates and a cause in which it ends. The originating

cause is the primary efficient cause, which is something already

endowed with tangible existence, while the final cause is some

definite form or similar end; for man generates man, and plant

generates plant, in each case out of the underlying material.)

  In order of time, then, the material and the generative process must

necessarily be anterior to the being that is generated; but in logical

order the definitive character and form of each being precedes the

material. This is evident if one only tries to define the process of

formation. For the definition of house-building includes and

presupposes that of the house; but the definition of the house does

not include nor presuppose that of house-building; and the same is

true of all other productions. So that it must necessarily be that the

elementary material exists for the sake of the homogeneous parts,

seeing that these are genetically posterior to it, just as the

heterogeneous parts are posterior genetically to them. For these

heterogeneous parts have reached the end and goal, having the third

degree of composition, in which degree generation or development often

attains its final term.

  Animals, then, are composed of homogeneous parts, and are also

composed of heterogeneous parts. The former, however, exist for the

sake of the latter. For the active functions and operations of the

body are carried on by these; that is, by the heterogeneous parts,

such as the eye, the nostril, the whole face, the fingers, the hand,

and the whole arm. But inasmuch as there is a great variety in the

functions and motions not only of aggregate animals but also of the

individual organs, it is necessary that the substances out of which

these are composed shall present a diversity of properties. For some

purposes softness is advantageous, for others hardness; some parts

must be capable of extension, others of flexion. Such properties,

then, are distributed separately to the different homogeneous parts,

one being soft another hard, one fluid another solid, one viscous

another brittle; whereas each of the heterogeneous parts presents a

combination of multifarious properties. For the hand, to take an

example, requires one property to enable it to effect pressure, and

another and different property for simple prehension. For this

reason the active or executive parts of the body are compounded out of

bones, sinews, flesh, and the like, but not these latter out of the

former.

  So far, then, as has yet been stated, the relations between these

two orders of parts are determined by a final cause. We have, however,

to inquire whether necessity may not also have a share in the

matter; and it must be admitted that these mutual relations could

not from the very beginning have possibly been other than they are.

For heterogeneous parts can be made up out of homogeneous parts,

either from a plurality of them, or from a single one, as is the

case with some of the viscera which, varying in configuration, are

yet, to speak broadly, formed from a single homogeneous substance; but

that homogeneous substances should be formed out of a combination of

heterogeneous parts is clearly an impossibility. For these causes,

then, some parts of animals are simple and homogeneous, while others

are composite and heterogeneous; and dividing the parts into the

active or executive and the sensitive, each one of the former is, as

before said, heterogeneous, and each one of the latter homogeneous.

For it is in homogeneous parts alone that sensation can occur, as

the following considerations show.

  Each sense is confined to a single order of sensibles, and its organ

must be such as to admit the action of that kind or order. But it is

only that which is endowed with a property in posse that is acted on

by that which has the like property in esse, so that the two are the

same in kind, and if the latter is single so also is the former.

Thus it is that while no physiologists ever dream of saying of the

hand or face or other such part that one is earth, another water,

another fire, they couple each separate sense-organ with a separate

element, asserting this one to be air and that other to be fire.

  Sensation, then, is confined to the simple or homogeneous parts.

But, as might reasonably be expected, the organ of touch, though still

homogeneous, is yet the least simple of all the sense-organs. For

touch more than any other sense appears to be correlated to several

distinct kinds of objects, and to recognize more than one category

of contrasts, heat and cold, for instance, solidity and fluidity,

and other similar oppositions. Accordingly, the organ which deals with

these varied objects is of all the sense-organs the most corporeal,

being either the flesh, or the substance which in some animals takes

the place of flesh.

  Now as there cannot possibly be an animal without sensation, it

follows as a necessary consequence that every animal must have some

homogeneous parts; for these alone are capable of sensation, the

heterogeneous parts serving for the active functions. Again, as the

sensory faculty, the motor faculty, and the nutritive faculty are

all lodged in one and the same part of the body, as was stated in a

former treatise, it is necessary that the part which is the primary

seat of these principles shall on the one hand, in its character of

general sensory recipient, be one of the simple parts; and on the

other hand shall, in its motor and active character, be one of the

heterogeneous parts. For this reason it is the heart which in

sanguineous animals constitutes this central part, and in bloodless

animals it is that which takes the place of a heart. For the heart,

like the other viscera, is one of the homogeneous parts; for, if cut

up, its pieces are homogeneous in substance with each other. But it is

at the same time heterogeneous in virtue of its definite

configuration. And the same is true of the other so-called viscera,

which are indeed formed from the same material as the heart. For all

these viscera have a sanguineous character owing to their being

situated upon vascular ducts and branches. For just as a stream of

water deposits mud, so the various viscera, the heart excepted, are,

as it were, deposits from the stream of blood in the vessels. And as

to the heart, the very starting-point of the vessels, and the actual

seat of the force by which the blood is first fabricated, it is but

what one would naturally expect, that out of the selfsame nutriment of

which it is the recipient its own proper substance shall be formed.

Such, then, are the reasons why the viscera are of sanguineous aspect;

and why in one point of view they are homogeneous, in another

heterogeneous.



                                 2



  Of the homogeneous parts of animals, some are soft and fluid, others

hard and solid; and of the former some are fluid permanently, others

only so long as they are in the living body. Such are blood, serum,

lard, suet, marrow, semen, bile, milk when present, flesh, and their

various analogues. For the parts enumerated are not to be found in all

animals, some animals only having parts analogous to them. Of the hard

and solid homogeneous parts bone, fish-spine, sinew, blood-vessel, are

examples. The last of these points to a sub-division that may be

made in the class of homogeneous parts. For in some of them the

whole and a portion of the whole in one sense are designated by the

same term-as, for example, is the case with blood-vessel and bit of

blood-vessel-while in another sense they are not; but a portion of a

heterogeneous part, such as face, in no sense has the same designation

as the whole.

  The first question to be asked is what are the causes to which these

homogeneous parts owe their existence? The causes are various; and

this whether the parts be solid or fluid. Thus one set of

homogeneous parts represent the material out of which the

heterogeneous parts are formed; for each separate organ is constructed

of bones, sinews, flesh, and the like; which are either essential

elements in its formation, or contribute to the proper discharge of

its function. A second set are the nutriment of the first, and are

invariably fluid, for all growth occurs at the expense of fluid

matter; while a third set are the residue of the second. Such, for

instance, are the faeces and, in animals that have a bladder, the

urine; the former being the dregs of the solid nutriment, the latter

of the fluid.

  Even the individual homogeneous parts present variations, which

are intended in each case to render them more serviceable for their

purpose. The variations of the blood may be selected to illustrate

this. For different bloods differ in their degrees of thinness or

thickness, of clearness or turbidity, of coldness or heat; and this

whether we compare the bloods from different parts of the same

individual or the bloods of different animals. For, in the individual,

all the differences just enumerated distinguish the blood of the upper

and of the lower halves of the body; and, dealing with classes, one

section of animals is sanguineous, while the other has no blood, but

only something resembling it in its place. As regards the results of

such differences, the thicker and the hotter blood is, the more

conducive is it to strength, while in proportion to its thinness and

its coldness is its suitability for sensation and intelligence. A like

distinction exists also in the fluid which is analogous to blood. This

explains how it is that bees and other similar creatures are of a more

intelligent nature than many sanguineous animals; and that, of

sanguineous animals, those are the most intelligent whose blood is

thin and cold. Noblest of all are those whose blood is hot, and at the

same time thin and clear. For such are suited alike for the

development of courage and of intelligence. Accordingly, the upper

parts are superior in these respects to the lower, the male superior

to the female, and the right side to the left. As with the blood so

also with the other parts, homogeneous and heterogeneous alike. For

here also such variations as occur must be held either to be related

to the essential constitution and mode of life of the several animals,

or, in other cases, to be merely matters of slightly better or

slightly worse. Two animals, for instance, may have eyes. But in one

these eyes may be of fluid consistency, while in the other they are

hard; and in one there may be eyelids, in the other no such

appendages. In such a case, the fluid consistency and the presence

of eyelids, which are intended to add to the accuracy of vision, are

differences of degree. As to why all animals must of necessity have

blood or something of a similar character, and what the nature of

blood may be, these are matters which can only be considered when we

have first discussed hot and cold. For the natural properties of

many substances are referable to these two elementary principles;

and it is a matter of frequent dispute what animals or what parts of

animals are hot and what cold. For some maintain that water animals

are hotter than such as live on land, asserting that their natural

heat counterbalances the coldness of their medium; and again, that

bloodless animals are hotter than those with blood, and females than

males. Parmenides, for instance, and some others declare that women

are hotter than men, and that it is the warmth and abundance of

their blood which causes their menstrual flow, while Empedocles

maintains the opposite opinion. Again, comparing the blood and the

bile, some speak of the former as hot and of the latter as cold, while

others invert the description. If there be this endless disputing

about hot and cold, which of all things that affect our senses are the

most distinct, what are we to think as to our other sensory

impressions?

  The explanation of the difficulty appears to be that the term

'hotter' is used in several senses; so that different statements,

though in verbal contradiction with each other, may yet all be more or

less true. There ought, then, to be some clear understanding as to the

sense in which natural substances are to be termed hot or cold,

solid or fluid. For it appears manifest that these are properties on

which even life and death are largely dependent, and that they are

moreover the causes of sleep and waking, of maturity and old age, of

health and disease; while no similar influence belongs to roughness

and smoothness, to heaviness and lightness, nor, in short, to any

other such properties of matter. That this should be so is but in

accordance with rational expectation. For hot and cold, solid and

fluid, as was stated in a former treatise, are the foundations of

the physical elements.

  Is then the term hot used in one sense or in many? To answer this we

must ascertain what special effect is attributed to a hotter

substance, and if there be several such, how many these may be. A body

then is in one sense said to be hotter than another, if it impart a

greater amount of heat to an object in contact with it. In a second

sense, that is said to be hotter which causes the keener sensation

when touched, and especially if the sensation be attended with pain.

This criterion, however, would seem sometimes to be a false one; for

occasionally it is the idiosyncrasy of the individual that causes

the sensation to be painful. Again, of two things, that is the

hotter which the more readily melts a fusible substance, or sets on

fire an inflammable one. Again, of two masses of one and the same

substance, the larger is said to have more heat than the smaller.

Again, of two bodies, that is said to be the hotter which takes the

longer time in cooling, as also we call that which is rapidly heated

hotter than that which is long about it; as though the rapidity

implied proximity and this again similarity of nature, while the

want of rapidity implied distance and this again dissimilarity of

nature. The term hotter is used then in all the various senses that

have been mentioned, and perhaps in still more. Now it is impossible

for one body to be hotter than another in all these different

fashions. Boiling water for instance, though it is more scalding

than flame, yet has no power of burning or melting combustible or

fusible matter, while flame has. So again this boiling water is hotter

than a small fire, and yet gets cold more rapidly and completely.

For in fact fire never becomes cold; whereas water invariably does so.

Boiling water, again, is hotter to the touch than oil; yet it gets

cold and solid more rapidly than this other fluid. Blood, again, is

hotter to the touch than either water or oil, and yet coagulates

before them. Iron, again, and stones and other similar bodies are

longer in getting heated than water, but when once heated burn other

substances with a much greater intensity. Another distinction is this.

In some of the bodies which are called hot the heat is derived from

without, while in others it belongs to the bodies themselves; and it

makes a most important difference whether the heat has the former or

the latter origin. For to call that one of two bodies the hotter,

which is possessed of heat, we may almost say, accidentally and not of

its own essence, is very much the same thing as if, finding that

some man in a fever was a musician, one were to say that musicians are

hotter than healthy men. Of that which is hot per se and that which is

hot per accidens, the former is the slower to cool, while not rarely

the latter is the hotter to the touch. The former again is the more

burning of the two-flame, for instance, as compared with boiling

water-while the latter, as the boiling water, which is hot per

accidens, is the more heating to the touch. From all this it is

clear that it is no simple matter to decide which of two bodies is the

hotter. For the first may be the hotter in one sense, the second the

hotter in another. Indeed in some of these cases it is impossible to

say simply even whether a thing is hot or not. For the actual

substratum may not itself be hot, but may be hot when coupled witb

heat as an attribute, as would be the case if one attached a single

name to hot water or hot iron. It is after this manner that blood is

hot. In such cases, in those, that is, in which the substratum owes

its heat to an external influence, it is plain that cold is not a mere

privation, but an actual existence.

  There is no knowing but that even fire may be another of these

cases. For the substratum of fire may be smoke or charcoal, and though

the former of these is always hot, smoke being an uprising vapour, yet

the latter becomes cold when its flame is extinguished, as also

would oil and pinewood under similar circumstances. But even

substances that have been burnt nearly all possess some heat, cinders,

for example, and ashes, the dejections also of animals, and, among the

excretions, bile; because some residue of heat has been left in them

after their combustion. It is in another sense that pinewood and fat

substances are hot; namely, because they rapidly assume the

actuality of fire.

  Heat appears to cause both coagulation and melting. Now such

things as are formed merely of water are solidified by cold, while

such as are formed of nothing but earth are solidified by fire. Hot

substances again are solidified by cold, and, when they consist

chiefly of earth, the process of solidification is rapid, and the

resulting substance is insoluble; but, when their main constituent

is water, the solid matter is again soluble. What kinds of substances,

however, admit of being solidified, and what are the causes of

solidification, are questions that have already been dealt with more

precisely in another treatise.

  In conclusion, then, seeing that the terms hot and hotter are used

in many different senses, and that no one substance can be hotter than

others in all these senses, we must, when we attribute this

character to an object, add such further statements as that this

substance is hotter per se, though that other is often hotter per

accidens; or again, that this substance is potentially hot, that other

actually so; or again, that this substance is hotter in the sense of

causing a greater feeling of heat when touched, while that other is

hotter in the sense of producing flame and burning. The term hot being

used in all these various senses, it plainly follows that the term

cold will also be used with like ambiguity.

  So much then as to the signification of the terms hot and cold,

hotter and colder.



                                 3



  In natural sequence we have next to treat of solid and fluid.

These terms are used in various senses. Sometimes, for instance,

they denote things that are potentially, at other times things that

are actually, solid or fluid. Ice for example, or any other solidified

fluid, is spoken of as being actually and accidentally solid, while

potentially and essentially it is fluid. Similarly earth and ashes and

the like, when mixed with water, are actually and accidentally

fluid, but potentially and essentially are solid. Now separate the

constituents in such a mixture and you have on the one hand the watery

components to which its fluidity was due, and these are both

actually and potentially fluid, and on the other hand the earthy

components, and these are in every way solid; and it is to bodies that

are solid in this complete manner that the term 'solid' is most

properly and absolutely applicable. So also the opposite term

'fluld' is strictly and absolutely applicable to that only which is

both potentially and actually fluid. The same remark applies also to

hot bodies and to cold.

  These distinctions, then, being laid down, it is plain that blood is

essentially hot in so far as that heat is connoted in its name; just

as if boiling water were denoted by a single term, boiling would be

connoted in that term. But the substratum of blood, that which it is

in substance while it is blood in form, is not hot. Blood then in a

certain sense is essentially hot, and in another sense is not so.

For heat is included in the definition of blood, just as whiteness

is included in the definition of a white man, and so far therefore

blood is essentially hot. But so far as blood becomes hot from some

external influence, it is not hot essentially.

  As with hot and cold, so also is it with solid and fluid. We can

therefore understand how some substances are hot and fluid so long

as they remain in the living body, but become perceptibly cold and

coagulate so soon as they are separated from it; while others are

hot and consistent while in the body, but when withdrawn under a

change to the opposite condition, and become cold and fluid. Of the

former blood is an example, of the latter bile; for while blood

solidifies when thus separated, yellow bile under the same

circumstances becomes more fluid. We must attribute to such substances

the possession of opposite properties in a greater or less degree.

  In what sense, then, the blood is hot and in what sense fluid, and

how far it partakes of the opposite properties, has now been fairly

explained. Now since everything that grows must take nourishment,

and nutriment in all cases consists of fluid and solid substances, and

since it is by the force of heat that these are concocted and changed,

it follows that all living things, animals and plants alike, must on

this account, if on no other, have a natural source of heat. This

natural heat, moreover, must belong to many parts, seeing that the

organs by which the various elaborations of the food are effected

are many in number. For first of all there is the mouth and the

parts inside the mouth, on which the first share in the duty clearly

devolves, in such animals at least as live on food which requires

disintegration. The mouth, however, does not actually concoct the

food, but merely facilitates concoction; for the subdivision of the

food into small bits facilitates the action of heat upon it. After the

mouth come the upper and the lower abdominal cavities, and here it

is that concoction is effected by the aid of natural heat. Again, just

as there is a channel for the admission of the unconcocted food into

the stomach, namely the mouth, and in some animals the so-called

oesophagus, which is continuous with the mouth and reaches to the

stomach, so must there also be other and more numerous channels by

which the concocted food or nutriment shall pass out of the stomach

and intestines into the body at large, and to which these cavities

shall serve as a kind of manger. For plants get their food from the

earth by means of their roots; and this food is already elaborated

when taken in, which is the reason why plants produce no excrement,

the earth and its heat serving them in the stead of a stomach. But

animals, with scarcely an exception, and conspicuously all such as are

capable of locomotion, are provided with a stomachal sac, which is

as it were an internal substitute for the earth. They must therefore

have some instrument which shall correspond to the roots of plants,

with which they may absorb their food from this sac, so that the

proper end of the successive stages of concoction may at last be

attained. The mouth then, its duty done, passes over the food to the

stomach, and there must necessarily be something to receive it in turn

from this. This something is furnished by the bloodvessels, which

run throughout the whole extent of the mesentery from its lowest

part right up to the stomach. A description of these will be found

in the treatises on Anatomy and Natural History. Now as there is a

receptacle for the entire matter taken as food, and also a

receptacle for its excremental residue, and again a third

receptacle, namely the vessels, which serve as such for the blood,

it is plain that this blood must be the final nutritive material in

such animals as have it; while in bloodless animals the same is the

case with the fluid which represents the blood. This explains why

the blood diminishes in quantity when no food is taken, and

increases when much is consumed, and also why it becomes healthy and

unhealthy according as the food is of the one or the other

character. These facts, then, and others of a like kind, make it plain

that the purpose of the blood in sanguineous animals is to subserve

the nutrition of the body. They also explain why no more sensation

is produced by touching the blood than by touching one of the

excretions or the food, whereas when the flesh is touched sensation is

produced. For the blood is not continuous nor united by growth with

the flesh, but simply lies loose in its receptacle, that is in the

heart and vessels. The manner in which the parts grow at the expense

of the blood, and indeed the whole question of nutrition, will find

a more suitable place for exposition in the treatise on Generation,

and in other writings. For our present purpose all that need be said

is that the blood exists for the sake of nutrition, that is the

nutrition of the parts; and with this much let us therefore content

ourselves.



                                 4



  What are called fibres are found in the blood of some animals but

not of all. There are none, for instance, in the blood of deer and

of roes; and for this reason the blood of such animals as these

never coagulates. For one part of the blood consists mainly of water

and therefore does not coagulate, this process occurring only in the

other and earthy constituent, that is to say in the fibres, while

the fluid part is evaporating.

  Some at any rate of the animals with watery blood have a keener

intellect than those whose blood is of an earthier nature. This is due

not to the coldness of their blood, but rather to its thinness and

purity; neither of which qualities belongs to the earthy matter. For

the thinner and purer its fluid is, the more easily affected is an

animal's sensibility. Thus it is that some bloodless animals,

notwithstanding their want of blood, are yet more intelligent than

some among the sanguineous kinds. Such for instance, as already

said, is the case with the bee and the tribe of ants, and whatever

other animals there may be of a like nature. At the same time too

great an excess of water makes animals timorous. For fear chills the

body; so that in animals whose heart contains so watery a mixture

the way is prepared for the operation of this emotion. For water is

congealed by cold. This also explains why bloodless animals are, as

a general rule, more timorous than such as have blood, so that they

remain motionless, when frightened, and discharge their excretions,

and in some instances change colour. Such animals, on the other

hand, as have thick and abundant fibres in their blood are of a more

earthy nature, and of a choleric temperament, and liable to bursts

of passion. For anger is productive of heat; and solids, when they

have been made hot, give off more heat than fluids. The fibres

therefore, being earthy and solid, are turned into so many hot

embers in the blood, like the embers in a vapour-bath, and cause

ebullition in the fits of passion.

  This explains why bulls and boars are so choleric and so passionate.

For their blood is exceedingly rich in fibres, and the bull's at any

rate coagulates more rapidly than that of any other animal. If these

fibres, that is to say if the earthy constituents of which we are

speaking, are taken out of the blood, the fluid that remains behind

will no longer coagulate; just as the watery residue of mud will not

coagulate after removal of the earth. But if the fibres are left the

fluid coagulates, as also does mud, under the influence of cold. For

when the heat is expelled by the cold, the fluid, as has been

already stated, passes off with it by evaporation, and the residue

is dried up and solidified, not by heat but by cold. So long, however,

as the blood is in the body, it is kept fluid by animal heat.

  The character of the blood affects both the temperament and the

sensory faculties of animals in many ways. This is indeed what might

reasonably be expected, seeing that the blood is the material of which

the whole body is made. For nutriment supplies the material, and the

blood is the ultimate nutriment. It makes then a considerable

difference whether the blood be hot or cold, thin or thick, turbid

or clear.

  The watery part of the blood is serum; and it is watery, either

owing to its not being yet concocted, or owing to its having become

corrupted; so that one part of the serum is the resultant of a

necessary process, while another part is material intended to serve

for the formation of the blood.

                                 5



  The differences between lard and suet correspond to differences of

blood. For both are blood concocted into these forms as a result of

abundant nutrition, being that surplus blood that is not expended on

the fleshy part of the body, and is of an easily concocted and fatty

character. This is shown by the unctuous aspect of these substances;

for such unctuous aspect in fluids is due to a combination of air

and fire. It follows from what has been said that no non-sanguineous

animals have either lard or suet; for they have no blood. Among

sanguineous animals those whose blood is dense have suet rather than

lard. For suet is of an earthy nature, that is to say, it contains but

a small proportion of water and is chiefly composed of earth; and this

it is that makes it coagulate, just as the fibrous matter of blood

coagulates, or broths which contain such fibrous matter. Thus it is

that in those horned animals that have no front teeth in the upper jaw

the fat consists of suet. For the very fact that they have horns and

huckle-bones shows that their composition is rich in this earthy

element; for all such appurtenances are solid and earthy in character.

On the other hand in those hornless animals that have front teeth in

both jaws, and whose feet are divided into toes, there is no suet, but

in its place lard; and this, not being of an earthy character, neither

coagulates nor dries up into a friable mass.

  Both lard and suet when present in moderate amount are beneficial;

for they contribute to health and strength, while they are no

hindrance to sensation. But when they are present in great excess,

they are injurious and destructive. For were the whole body formed

of them it would perish. For an animal is an animal in virtue of its

sensory part, that is in virtue of its flesh, or of the substance

analogous to flesh. But the blood, as before stated, is not sensitive;

as therefore is neither lard nor suet, seeing that they are nothing

but concocted blood. Were then the whole body composed of these

substances, it would be utterly without sensation. Such animals,

again, as are excessively fat age rapidly. For so much of their

blood is used in forming fat, that they have but little left; and when

there is but little blood the way is already open for decay. For decay

may be said to be deficiency of blood, the scantiness of which renders

it liable, like all bodies of small bulk, to be injuriously affected

by any chance excess of heat or cold. For the same reason fat

animals are less prolific than others. For that part of the blood

which should go to form semen and seed is used up in the production of

lard and suet, which are nothing but concocted blood; so that in these

animals there is either no reproductive excretion at all, or only a

scanty amount.



                                 6



  So much then of blood and serum, and of lard and suet. Each of these

has been described, and the purposes told for which they severally

exist. The marrow also is of the nature of blood, and not, as some

think, the germinal force of the semen. That this is the case is quite

evident in very young animals. For in the embryo the marrow of the

bones has a blood-like appearance, which is but natural, seeing that

the parts are all constructed out of blood, and that it is on blood

that the embryo is nourished. But, as the young animal grows up and

ripens into maturity, the marrow changes its colour, just as do the

external parts and the viscera. For the viscera also in animals, so

long as they are young, have each and all a blood-like look, owing

to the large amount of this fluid which they contain.

  The consistency of the marrow agrees with that of the fat. For

when the fat consists of lard, then the marrow also is unctuous and

lard-like; but when the blood is converted by concoction into suet,

and does not assume the form of lard, then the marrow also has a suety

character. In those animals, therefore, that have horns and are

without upper front teeth, the marrow has the character of suet; while

it takes the form of lard in those that have front teeth in both jaws,

and that also have the foot divided into toes. What has ben said

hardly applies to the spinal marrow. For it is necessary that this

shall be continuous and extend without break through the whole

backbone, inasmuch as this bone consists of separate vertebrae. But

were the spinal marrow either of unctuous fat or of suet, it could not

hold together in such a continuous mass as it does, but would either

be too fluid or too frangible.

  There are some animals that can hardly be said to have any marrow.

These are those whose bones are strong and solid, as is the case

with the lion. For in this animal the marrow is so utterly

insignificant that the bones look as though they had none at all.

However, as it is necessary that animals shall have bones or something

analogous to them, such as the fish-spines of water-animals, it is

also a matter of necessity that some of these bones shall contain

marrow; for the substance contained within the bones is the

nutriment out of which these are formed. Now the universal

nutriment, as already stated, is blood; and the blood within the bone,

owing to the heat which is developed in it from its being thus

surrounded, undergoes concoction, and self-concocted blood is suet

or lard; so that it is perfectly intelligible how the marrow within

the bone comes to have the character of these substances. So also it

is easy to understand why, in those animals that have strong and

compact bones, some of these should be entirely void of marrow,

while the rest contain but little of it; for here the nutriment is

spent in forming the bones.

  Those animals that have fish-spines in place of bones have no

other marrow than that of the chine. For in the first place they

have naturally but a small amount of blood; and secondly the only

hollow fish-spine is that of the chine. In this then marrow is formed;

this being the only spine in which there is space for it, and,

moreover, being the only one which owing to its division into parts

requires a connecting bond. This too is the reason why the marrow of

the chine, as already mentioned, is somewhat different from that of

other bones. For, having to act the part of a clasp, it must be of

glutinous character, and at the same time sinewy so as to admit of

stretching.

  Such then are the reasons for the existence of marrow, in those

animals that have any, and such its nature. It is evidently the

surplus of the sanguineous nutriment apportioned to the bones and

fish-spines, which has undergone concoction owing to its being

enclosed within them.



                                 7



  From the marrow we pass on in natural sequence to the brain. For

there are many who think that the brain itself consists of marrow, and

that it forms the commencement of that substance, because they see

that the spinal marrow is continuous with it. In reality the two may

be said to be utterly opposite to each other in character. For of

all the parts of the body there is none so cold as the brain;

whereas the marrow is of a hot nature, as is plainly shown by its

fat and unctuous character. Indeed this is the very reason why the

brain and spinal marrow are continuous with each other. For,

wherever the action of any part is in excess, nature so contrives as

to set by it another part with an excess of contrary action, so that

the excesses of the two may counterbalance each other. Now that the

marrow is hot is clearly shown by many indications. The coldness of

the brain is also manifest enough. For in the first place it is cold

even to the touch; and, secondly, of all the fluid parts of the body

it is the driest and the one that has the least blood; for in fact

it has no blood at all in its proper substance. This brain is not

residual matter, nor yet is it one of the parts which are anatomically

continuous with each other; but it has a character peculiar to itself,

as might indeed be expected. That it has no continuity with the organs

of sense is plain from simple inspection, and is still more clearly

shown by the fact, that, when it is touched, no sensation is produced;

in which respect it resembles the blood of animals and their

excrement. The purpose of its presence in animals is no less than

the preservation of the whole body. For some writers assert that the

soul is fire or some such force. This, however, is but a rough and

inaccurate assertion; and it would perhaps be better to say that the

soul is incorporate in some substance of a fiery character. The reason

for this being so is that of all substances there is none so

suitable for ministering to the operations of the soul as that which

is possessed of heat. For nutrition and the imparting of motion are

offices of the soul, and it is by heat that these are most readily

effected. To say then that the soul is fire is much the same thing

as to confound the auger or the saw with the carpenter or his craft,

simply because the work is wrought by the two in conjunction. So far

then this much is plain, that all animals must necessarily have a

certain amount of heat. But as all influences require to be

counterbalanced, so that they may be reduced to moderation and brought

to the mean (for in the mean, and not in either extreme, lies the true

and rational position), nature has contrived the brain as a

counterpoise to the region of the heart with its contained heat, and

has given it to animals to moderate the latter, combining in it the

properties of earth and water. For this reason it is, that every

sanguineous animal has a brain; whereas no bloodless creature has such

an organ, unless indeed it be, as the Poulp, by analogy. For where

there is no blood, there in consequence there is but little heat.

The brain, then, tempers the heat and seething of the heart. In order,

however, that it may not itself be absolutely without heat, but may

have a moderate amount, branches run from both blood-vessels, that

is to say from the great vessel and from what is called the aorta, and

end in the membrane which surrounds the brain; while at the same time,

in order to prevent any injury from the heat, these encompassing

vessels, instead of being few and large, are numerous and small, and

their blood scanty and clear, instead of being abundant and thick.

We can now understand why defluxions have their origin in the head,

and occur whenever the parts about the brain have more than a due

proportion of coldness. For when the nutriment steams upwards

through the blood-vessels, its refuse portion is chilled by the

influence of this region, and forms defluxions of phlegm and serum. We

must suppose, to compare small things with great, that the like

happens here as occurs in the production of showers. For when vapour

steams up from the earth and is carried by the heat into the upper

regions, so soon as it reaches the cold air that is above the earth,

it condenses again into water owing to the refrigeration, and falls

back to the earth as rain. These, however, are matters which may be

suitably considered in the Principles of Diseases, so far as natural

philosophy has anything to say to them.

  It is the brain again-or, in animals that have no brain, the part

analogous to it-which is the cause of sleep. For either by chilling

the blood that streams upwards after food, or by some other similar

influences, it produces heaviness in the region in which it lies

(which is the reason why drowsy persons hang the head), and causes the

heat to escape downwards in company with the blood. It is the

accumulation of this in excess in the lower region that produces

complete sleep, taking away the power of standing upright from those

animals to whom that posture is natural, and from the rest the power

of holding up the head. These, however, are matters which have been

separately considered in the treatises on Sensation and on Sleep.

  That the brain is a compound of earth and water is shown by what

occurs when it is boiled. For, when so treated, it turns hard and

solid, inasmuch as the water is evaporated by the heat, and leaves the

earthy part behind. Just the same occurs when pulse and other fruits

are boiled. For these also are hardened by the process, because the

water which enters into their composition is driven off and leaves the

earth, which is their main constituent, behind.

  Of all animals, man has the largest brain in proportion to his size;

and it is larger in men than in women. This is because the region of

the heart and of the lung is hotter and richer in blood in man than in

any other animal; and in men than in women. This again explains why

man, alone of animals, stands erect. For the heat, overcoming any

opposite inclination, makes growth take its own line of direction,

which is from the centre of the body upwards. It is then as a

counterpoise to his excessive heat that in man's brain there is this

superabundant fluidity and coldness; and it is again owing to this

superabundance that the cranial bone, which some call the Bregma, is

the last to become solidified; so long does evaporation continue to

occur through it under the influence of heat. Man is the only

sanguineous animal in which this takes place. Man, again, has more

sutures in his skull than any other animal, and the male more than the

female. The explanation is again to be found in the greater size of

the brain, which demands free ventilation, proportionate to its

bulk. For if the brain be either too fluid or too solid, it will not

perform its office, but in the one case will freeze the blood, and

in the other will not cool it at all; and thus will cause disease,

madness, and death. For the cardiac heat and the centre of life is

most delicate in its sympathies, and is immediately sensitive to the

slightest change or affection of the blood on the outer surface of the

brain.

  The fluids which are present in the animal body at the time of birth

have now nearly all been considered. Amongst those that appear only at

a later period are the residua of the food, which include the deposits

of the belly and also those of the bladder. Besides these there is the

semen and the milk, one or the other of which makes its appearance

in appropriate animals. Of these fluids the excremental residua of the

food may be suitably discussed by themselves, when we come to

examine and consider the subject of nutrition. Then will be the time

to explain in what animals they are found, and what are the reasons

for their presence. Similarly all questions concerning the semen and

the milk may be dealt with in the treatise on Generation, for the

former of these fluids is the very starting-point of the generative

process, and the latter has no other ground of existence than

generative purposes.



                                 8



  We have now to consider the remaining homogeneous parts, and will

begin with flesh, and with the substance that, in animals that have no

flesh, takes its place. The reason for so beginning is that flesh

forms the very basis of animals, and is the essential constituent of

their body. Its right to this precedence can also be demonstrated

logically. For an animal is by our definition something that has

sensibility and chief of all the primary sensibility, which is that of

Touch; and it is the flesh, or analogous substance, which is the organ

of this sense. And it is the organ, either in the same way as the

pupil is the organ of sight, that is it constitutes the primary

organ of the sense; or it is the organ and the medium through which

the object acts combined, that is it answers to the pupil with the

whole transparent medium attached to it. Now in the case of the

other senses it was impossible for nature to unite the medium with the

sense-organ, nor would such a junction have served any purpose; but in

the case of touch she was compelled by necessity to do so. For of

all the sense-organs that of touch is the only one that has

corporeal substance, or at any rate it is more corporeal than any

other, and its medium must be corporeal like itself.

  It is obvious also to sense that it is for the sake of the flesh

that all the other parts exist. By the other parts I mean the bones,

the skin, the sinews, and the blood-vessels, and, again, the hair

and the various kinds of nails, and anything else there may be of a

like character. Thus the bones are a contrivance to give security to

the soft parts, to which purpose they are adapted by their hardness;

and in animals that have no bones the same office is fulfilled by some

analogous substance, as by fishspine in some fishes, and by

cartilage in others.

  Now in some animals this supporting substance is situated within the

body, while in some of the bloodless species it is placed on the

outside. The latter is the case in all the Crustacea, as the Carcini

(Crabs) and the Carabi (Prickly Lobsters); it is the case also in

the Testacea, as for instance in the several species known by the

general name of oysters. For in all these animals the fleshy substance

is within, and the earthy matter, which holds the soft parts

together and keeps them from injury, is on the outside. For the

shell not only enables the soft parts to hold together, but also, as

the animal is bloodless and so has but little natural warmth,

surrounds it, as a chaufferette does the embers, and keeps in the

smouldering heat. Similar to this seems to be the arrangement in

another and distinct tribe of animals, namely the Tortoises, including

the Chelone and the several kinds of Emys. But in Insects and in

Cephalopods the plan is entirely different, there being moreover a

contrast between these two themselves. For in neither of these does

there appear to be any bony or earthy part, worthy of notice,

distinctly separated from the rest of the body. Thus in the

Cephalopods the main bulk of the body consists of a soft flesh-like

substance, or rather of a substance which is intermediate to flesh and

sinew, so as not to be so readily destructible as actual flesh. I call

this substance intermediate to flesh and sinew, because it is soft

like the former, while it admits of stretching like the latter. Its

cleavage, however, is such that it splits not longitudinally, like

sinew, but into circular segments, this being the most advantageous

condition, so far as strength is concerned. These animals have also

a part inside them corresponding to the spinous bones of fishes. For

instance, in the Cuttle-fishes there is what is known as the os

sepiae, and in the Calamaries there is the so-called gladius. In the

Poulps, on the other hand, there is no such internal part, because the

body, or, as it is termed in them, the head, forms but a short sac,

whereas it is of considerable length in the other two; and it was this

length which led nature to assign to them their hard support, so as to

ensure their straightness and inflexibility; just as she has

assigned to sanguineous animals their bones or their fish-spines, as

the case may be. To come now to Insects. In these the arrangement is

quite different from that of the Cephalopods; quite different also

from that which obtains in sanguineous animals, as indeed has been

already stated. For in an insect there is no distinction into soft and

hard parts, but the whole body is hard, the hardness, however, being

of such a character as to be more flesh-like than bone, and more

earthy and bone-like than flesh. The purpose of this is to make the

body of the insect less liable to get broken into pieces.



                                 9



  There is a resemblance between the osseous and the vascular systems;

for each has a central part in which it begins, and each forms a

continuous whole. For no bone in the body exists as a separate thing

in itself, but each is either a portion of what may be considered a

continuous whole, or at any rate is linked with the rest by contact

and by attachments; so that nature may use adjoining bones either as

though they were actually continuous and formed a single bone, or, for

purposes of flexure, as though they were two and distinct. And

similarly no blood-vessel has in itself a separate individuality;

but they all form parts of one whole. For an isolated bone, if such

there were, would in the first place be unable to perform the office

for the sake of which bones exist; for, were it discontinuous and

separated from the rest by a gap, it would be perfectly unable to

produce either flexure or extension; nor only so, but it would

actually be injurious, acting like a thorn or an arrow lodged in the

flesh. Similarly if a vessel were isolated, and not continuous with

the vascular centre, it would be unable to retain the blood within

it in a proper state. For it is the warmth derived from this centre

that hinders the blood from coagulating; indeed the blood, when

withdrawn from its influence, becomes manifestly putrid. Now the

centre or origin of the blood-vessels is the heart, and the centre

or origin of the bones, in all animals that have bones, is what is

called the chine. With this all the other bones of the body are in

continuity; for it is the chine that holds together the whole length

of an animal and preserves its straightness. But since it is necessary

that the body of an animal shall bend during locomotion, this chine,

while it is one in virtue of the continuity of its parts, yet its

division into vertebrae is made to consist of many segments. It is

from this chine that the bones of the limbs, in such animals as have

these parts, proceed, and with it they are continuous, being

fastened together by the sinews where the limbs admit of flexure,

and having their extremities adapted to each other, either by the

one being hollowed and the other rounded, or by both being hollowed

and including between them a hucklebone, as a connecting bolt, so as

to allow of flexure and extension. For without some such arrangement

these movements would be utterly impossible, or at any rate would be

performed with great difficulty. There are some joints, again, in

which the lower end of the one bone and the upper end of the other are

alike in shape. In these cases the bones are bound together by sinews,

and cartilaginous pieces are interposed in the joint, to serve as a

kind of padding, and prevent the two extremities from grating

against each other.

  Round about the bones, and attached to them by thin fibrous bands,

grow the fleshy parts, for the sake of which the bones themselves

exist. For just as an artist, when he is moulding an animal out of

clay or other soft substance, takes first some solid body as a

basis, and round this moulds the clay, so also has nature acted in

fashioning the animal body out of flesh. Thus we find all the fleshy

parts, with one exception, supported by bones, which serve, when the

parts are organs of motion, to facilitate flexure, and, when the parts

are motionless, act as a protection. The ribs, for example, which

enclose the chest are intended to ensure the safety of the heart and

neighbouring viscera. The exception of which mention was made is the

belly. The walls of this are in all animals devoid of bones; in

order that there may be no hindrance to the expansion which

necessarily occurs in this part after a meal, nor, in females, any

interference with the growth of the foetus, which is lodged here.

  Now the bones of viviparous animals, of such, that is, as are not

merely externally but also internally viviparous, vary but very little

from each other in point of strength, which in all of them is

considerable. For the Vivipara in their bodily proportions are far

above other animals, and many of them occasionally grow to an enormous

size, as is the case in Libya and in hot and dry countries

generally. But the greater the bulk of an animal, the stronger, the

bigger, and the harder, are the supports which it requires; and

comparing the big animals with each other, this requirement will be

most marked in those that live a life of rapine. Thus it is that the

bones of males are harder than those of females; and the bones of

flesh-eaters, that get their food by fighting, are harder than those

of Herbivora. Of this the Lion is an example; for so hard are its

bones, that, when struck, they give off sparks, as though they were

stones. It may be mentioned also that the Dolphin, in as much as it is

viviparous, is provided with bones and not with fish-spines.

  In those sanguineous animals, on the other hand, that are oviparous,

the bones present successive slight variations of character. Thus in

Birds there are bones, but these are not so strong as the bones of the

Vivipara. Then come the Oviparous fishes, where there is no bone,

but merely fish-spine. In the Serpents too the bones have the

character of fish-spine, excepting in the very large species, where

the solid foundation of the body requires to be stronger, in order

that the animal itself may be strong, the same reason prevailing as in

the case of the Vivipara. Lastly, in the Selachia, as they are called,

the fish-spines are replaced by cartilage. For it is necessary that

the movements of these animals shall be of an undulating character;

and this again requires the framework that supports the body to be

made of a pliable and not of a brittle substance. Moreover, in these

Selachia nature has used all the earthy matter on the skin; and she is

unable to allot to many different parts one and the same superfluity

of material. Even in viviparous animals many of the bones are

cartilaginous. This happens in those parts where it is to the

advantage of the surrounding flesh that its solid base shall be soft

and mucilaginous. Such, for instance, is the case with the ears and

nostrils; for in projecting parts, such as these, brittle substances

would soon get broken. Cartilage and bone are indeed fundamentally the

same thing, the differences between them being merely matters of

degree. Thus neither cartilage nor bone, when once cut off, grows

again. Now the cartilages of these land animals are without marrow,

that is without any distinctly separate marrow. For the marrow,

which in bones is distinctly separate, is here mixed up with the whole

mass, and gives a soft and mucilaginous consistence to the

cartilage. But in the Selachia the chine, though it is

cartilaginous, yet contains marrow; for here it stands in the stead of

a bone.

  Very nearly resembling the bones to the touch are such parts as

nails, hoofs, whether solid or cloven, horns, and the beaks of

birds, all of which are intended to serve as means of defence. For the

organs which are made out of these substances, and which are called by

the same names as the substances themselves, the organ hoof, for

instance, and the organ horn, are contrivances to ensure the

preservation of the animals to which they severally belong. In this

class too must be reckoned the teeth, which in some animals have but a

single function, namely the mastication of the food, while in others

they have an additional office, namely to serve as weapons; as is

the case with all animals that have sharp interfitting teeth or that

have tusks. All these parts are necessarily of solid and earthy

character; for the value of a weapon depends on such properties. Their

earthy character explains how it is that all such parts are more

developed in four-footed vivipara than in man. For there is always

more earth in the composition of these animals than in that of the

human body. However, not only all these parts but such others as are

nearly connected with them, skin for instance, bladder, membrane,

hairs, feathers, and their analogues, and any other similar parts that

there may be, will be considered farther on with the heterogeneous

parts. There we shall inquire into the causes which produce them,

and into the objects of their presence severally in the bodies of

animals. For, as with the heterogeneous parts, so with these, it is

from a consideration of their functions that alone we can derive any

knowledge of them. The reason for dealing with them at all in this

part of the treatise, and classifying them with the homogeneous parts,

is that under one and the same name are confounded the entire organs

and the substances of which they are composed. But of all these

substances flesh and bone form the basis. Semen and milk were also

passed over when we were considering the homogeneous fluids. For the

treatise on Generation will afford a more suitable place for their

examination, seeing that the former of the two is the very

foundation of the thing generated, while the latter is its

nourishment.



                                10



  Let us now make, as it were, a fresh beginning, and consider the

heterogeneous parts, taking those first which are the first in

importance. For in all animals, at least in all the perfect kinds,

there are two parts more essential than the rest, namely the part

which serves for the ingestion of food, and the part which serves

for the discharge of its residue. For without food growth and even

existence is impossible. Intervening again between these two parts

there is invariably a third, in which is lodged the vital principle.

As for plants, though they also are included by us among things that

have life, yet are they without any part for the discharge of waste

residue. For the food which they absorb from the ground is already

concocted, and they give off as its equivalent their seeds and fruits.

Plants, again, inasmuch as they are without locomotion, present no

great variety in their heterogeneous parts. For, where the functions

are but few, few also are the organs required to effect them. The

configuration of plants is a matter then for separate consideration.

Animals, however, that not only live but feel, present a greater

multiformity of parts, and this diversity is greater in some animals

than in others, being most varied in those to whose share has fallen

not mere life but life of high degree. Now such an animal is man.

For of all living beings with which we are acquainted man alone

partakes of the divine, or at any rate partakes of it in a fuller

measure than the rest. For this reason, then, and also because his

external parts and their forms are more familiar to us than those of

other animals, we must speak of man first; and this the more fitly,

because in him alone do the natural parts hold the natural position;

his upper part being turned towards that which is upper in the

universe. For, of all animals, man alone stands erect.

  In man, then, the head is destitute of flesh; this being the

necessary consequence of what has already been stated concerning the

brain. There are, indeed, some who hold that the life of man-would

be longer than it is, were his head more abundantly furnished with

flesh; and they account for the absence of this substance by saying

that it is intended to add to the perfection of sensation. For the

brain they assert to be the organ of sensation; and sensation, they

say, cannot penetrate to parts that are too thickly covered with

flesh. But neither part of this statement is true. On the contrary,

were the region of the brain thickly covered with flesh, the very

purpose for which animals are provided with a brain would be

directly contravened. For the brain would itself be heated to excess

and so unable to cool any other part; and, as to the other half of

their statement, the brain cannot be the cause of any of the

sensations, seeing that it is itself as utterly without feeling as any

one of the excretions. These writers see that certain of the senses

are located in the head, and are unable to discern the reason for

this; they see also that the brain is the most peculiar of all the

animal organs; and out of these facts they form an argument, by

which they link sensation and brain together. It has, however, already

been clearly set forth in the treatise on Sensation, that it is the

region of the heart that constitutes the sensory centre. There also it

was stated that two of the senses, namely touch and taste, are

manifestly in immediate connexion with the heart; and that as

regards the other three, namely hearing, sight, and the centrally

placed sense of smell, it is the character of their sense-organs which

causes them to be lodged as a rule in the head. Vision is so placed in

all animals. But such is not invariably the case with hearing or

with smell. For fishes and the like hear and smell, and yet have no

visible organs for these senses in the head; a fact which demonstrates

the accuracy of the opinion here maintained. Now that vision, whenever

it exists, should be in the neighbourhood of the brain is but what one

would rationally expect. For the brain is fluid and cold, and vision

is of the nature of water, water being of all transparent substances

the one most easily confined. Moreover it cannot but necessarily be

that the more precise senses will have their precision rendered

still greater if ministered to by parts that have the purest blood.

For the motion of the heat of blood destroys sensory activity. For

these reasons the organs of the precise senses are lodged in the head.

  It is not only the fore part of the head that is destitute of flesh,

but the hind part also. For, in all animals that have a head, it is

this head which more than any other part requires to be held up.

But, were the head heavily laden with flesh, this would be impossible;

for nothing so burdened can be held upright. This is an additional

proof that the absence of flesh from the head has no reference to

brain sensation. For there is no brain in the hinder part of the head,

and yet this is as much without flesh as is the front.

  In some animals hearing as well as vision is lodged in the region of

the head. Nor is this without a rational explanation. For what is

called the empty space is full of air, and the organ of hearing is, as

we say, of the nature of air. Now there are channels which lead from

the eyes to the blood-vessels that surround the brain; and similarly

there is a channel which leads back again from each ear and connects

it with the hinder part of the head. But no part that is without blood

is endowed with sensation, as neither is the blood itself, but only

some one of the parts that are formed of blood.

  The brain in all animals that have one is placed in the front part

of the head; because the direction in which sensation acts is in

front; and because the heart, from which sensation proceeds, is in the

front part of the body; and lastly because the instruments of

sensation are the blood-containing parts, and the cavity in the

posterior part of the skull is destitute of blood-vessels.

  As to the position of the sense-organs, they have been arranged by

nature in the following well-ordered manner. The organs of hearing are

so placed as to divide the circumference of the head into two equal

halves; for they have to hear not only sounds which are directly in

line with themselves, but sounds from all quarters. The organs of

vision are placed in front, because sight is exercised only in a

straight line, and moving as we do in a forward direction it is

necessary that we should see before us, in the direction of our

motion. Lastly, the organs of smell are placed with good reason

between the eyes. For as the body consists of two parts, a right

half and a left, so also each organ of sense is double. In the case of

touch this is not apparent, the reason being that the primary organ of

this sense is not the flesh or analogous part, but lies internally. In

the case of taste, which is merely a modification of touch and which

is placed in the tongue, the fact is more apparent than in the case of

touch, but still not so manifest as in the case of the other senses.

However, even in taste it is evident enough; for in some animals the

tongue is plainly forked. The double character of the sensations is,

however, more conspicuous in the other organs of sense. For there

are two ears and two eyes, and the nostrils, though joined together,

are also two. Were these latter otherwise disposed, and separated from

each other as are the ears, neither they nor the nose in which they

are placed would be able to perform their office. For in such

animals as have nostrils olfaction is effected by means of

inspiration, and the organ of inspiration is placed in front and in

the middle line. This is the reason why nature has brought the two

nostrils together and placed them as the central of the three

sense-organs, setting them side by side on a level with each other, to

avail themselves of the inspiratory motion. In other animals than

man the arrangement of these sense-organs is also such as is adapted

in each case to the special requirements.



                                11



  For instance, in quadrupeds the ears stand out freely from the

head and are set to all appearance above the eyes. Not that they are

in reality above the eyes; but they seem to be so, because the

animal does not stand erect, but has its head hung downwards. This

being the usual attitude of the animal when in motion, it is of

advantage that its ears shall be high up and movable; for by turning

themselves about they can the better take in sounds from every

quarter.



                                12



  In birds, on the other hand, there are no ears, but only the

auditory passages. This is because their skin is hard and because they

have feathers instead of hairs, so that they have not got the proper

material for the formation of ears. Exactly the same is the case

with such oviparous quadrupeds as are clad with scaly plates, and

the same explanation applies to them. There is also one of the

viviparous quadrupeds, namely the seal, that has no ears but only

the auditory passages. The explanation of this is that the seal,

though a quadruped, is a quadruped of stunted formation.



                                13



  Men, and Birds, and Quadrupeds, viviparous and oviparous alike, have

their eyes protected by lids. In the Vivipara there are two of

these; and both are used by these animals not only in closing the

eyes, but also in the act of blinking; whereas the oviparous

quadrupeds, and the heavy-bodied birds as well as some others, use

only the lower lid to close the eye; while birds blink by means of a

membrane that issues from the canthus. The reason for the eyes being

thus protected is that nature has made them of fluid consistency, in

order to ensure keenness of vision. For had they been covered with

hard skin, they would, it is true, have been less liable to get

injured by anything falling into them from without, but they would not

have been sharp-sighted. It is then to ensure keenness of vision

that the skin over the pupil is fine and delicate; while the lids

are superadded as a protection from injury. It is as a still further

safeguard that all these animals blink, and man most of all; this

action (which is not performed from deliberate intention but from a

natural instinct) serving to keep objects from falling into the

eyes; and being more frequent in man than in the rest of these

animals, because of the greater delicacy of his skin. These lids are

made of a roll of skin; and it is because they are made of skin and

contain no flesh that neither they, nor the similarly constructed

prepuce, unite again when once cut.

  As to the oviparous quadrupeds, and such birds as resemble them in

closing the eye with the lower lid, it is the hardness of the skin

of their heads which makes them do so. For such birds as have heavy

bodies are not made for flight; and so the materials which would

otherwise have gone to increase the growth of the feathers are

diverted thence, and used to augment the thickness of the skin.

Birds therefore of this kind close the eye with the lower lid; whereas

pigeons and the like use both upper and lower lids for the purpose. As

birds are covered with feathers, so oviparous quadrupeds are covered

with scaly plates; and these in all their forms are harder than hairs,

so that the skin also to which they belong is harder than the skin

of hairy animals. In these animals, then, the skin on the head is

hard, and so does not allow of the formation of an upper eyelid,

whereas lower down the integument is of a flesh-like character, so

that the lower lid can be thin and extensible.

  The act of blinking is performed by the heavy-bodied birds by

means of the membrane already mentioned, and not by this lower lid.

For in blinking rapid motion is required, and such is the motion of

this membrane, whereas that of the lower lid is slow. It is from the

canthus that is nearest to the nostrils that the membrane comes. For

it is better to have one starting-point for nictitation than two;

and in these birds this starting-point is the junction of eye and

nostrils, an anterior starting-point being preferable to a lateral

one. Oviparous quadrupeds do not blink in like manner as the birds;

for, living as they do on the ground, they are free from the necessity

of having eyes of fluid consistency and of keen sight, whereas these

are essential requisites for birds, inasmuch as they have to use their

eyes at long distances. This too explains why birds with talons,

that have to search for prey by eye from aloft, and therefore soar

to greater heights than other birds, are sharpsighted; while common

fowls and the like, that live on the ground and are not made for

flight, have no such keenness of vision. For there is nothing in their

mode of life which imperatively requires it.

  Fishes and Insects and the hard-skinned Crustacea present certain

differences in their eyes, but so far resemble each other as that none

of them have eyelids. As for the hard-skinned Crustacea it is

utterly out of the question that they should have any; for an

eyelid, to be of use, requires the action of the skin to be rapid.

These animals then have no eyelids and, in default of this protection,

their eyes are hard, just as though the lid were attached to the

surface of the eye, and the animal saw through it. Inasmuch,

however, as such hardness must necessarily blunt the sharpness of

vision, nature has endowed the eyes of Insects, and still more those

of Crustacea, with mobility (just as she has given some quadrupeds

movable ears), in order that they may be able to turn to the light and

catch its rays, and so see more plainly. Fishes, however, have eyes of

a fluid consistency. For animals that move much about have to use

their vision at considerable distances. If now they live on land,

the air in which they move is transparent enough. But the water in

which fishes live is a hindrance to sharp sight, though it has this

advantage over the air, that it does not contain so many objects to

knock against the eyes. The risk of collision being thus small,

nature, who makes nothing in vain, has given no eyelids to fishes,

while to counterbalance the opacity of the water she has made their

eyes of fluid consistency.



                                14



  All animals that have hairs on the body have lashes on the

eyelids; but birds and animals with scale-like plates, being hairless,

have none. The Libyan ostrich, indeed, forms an exception; for, though

a bird, it is furnished with eyelashes. This exception, however,

will be explained hereafter. Of hairy animals, man alone has lashes on

both lids. For in quadrupeds there is a greater abundance of hair on

the back than on the under side of the body; whereas in man the

contrary is the case, and the hair is more abundant on the front

surface than on the back. The reason for this is that hair is intended

to serve as a protection to its possessor. Now, in quadrupeds, owing

to their inclined attitude, the under or anterior surface does not

require so much protection as the back, and is therefore left

comparatively bald, in spite of its being the nobler of the two sides.

But in man, owing to his upright attitude, the anterior and

posterior surfaces of the body are on an equality as regards need of

protection. Nature therefore has assigned the protective covering to

the nobler of the two surfaces; for invariably she brings about the

best arrangement of such as are possible. This then is the reason that

there is no lower eyelash in any quadruped; though in some a few

scattered hairs sprout out under the lower lid. This also is the

reason that they never have hair in the axillae, nor on the pubes,

as man has. Their hair, then, instead of being collected in these

parts, is either thickly set over the whole dorsal surface, as is

the case for instance in dogs, or, sometimes, forms a mane, as in

horses and the like, or as in the male lion where the mane is still

more flowing and ample. So, again, whenever there is a tail of any

length, nature decks it with hair, with long hair if the stem of the

tail be short, as in horses, with short hair if the stem be long,

regard also being had to the condition of the rest of the body. For

nature invariably gives to one part what she subtracts from another.

Thus when she has covered the general surface of an animal's body with

an excess of hair, she leaves a deficiency in the region of the

tail. This, for instance, in the case with bears.

  No animal has so much hair on the head as man. This, in the first

place, is the necessary result of the fluid character of his brain,

and of the presence of so many sutures in his skull. For wherever

there is the most fluid and the most heat, there also must necessarily

occur the greatest outgrowth. But, secondly, the thickness of the hair

in this part has a final cause, being intended to protect the head, by

preserving it from excess of either heat or cold. And as the brain

of man is larger and more fluid than that of any other animal, it

requires a proportionately greater amount of protection. For the

more fluid a substance is, the more readily does it get excessively

heated or excessively chilled, while substances of an opposite

character are less liable to such injurious affections.

  These, however, are matters which by their close connexion with

eyelashes have led us to digress from our real topic, namely the cause

to which these lashes owe their existence. We must therefore defer any

further remarks we may have to make on these matters till the proper

occasion arises and then return to their consideration.



                                15



  Both eyebrows and eyelashes exist for the protection of the eyes;

the former that they may shelter them, like the eaves of a house, from

any fluids that trickle down from the head; the latter to act like the

palisades which are sometimes placed in front of enclosures, and

keep out any objects which might otherwise get in. The brows are

placed over the junction of two bones, which is the reason that in old

age they often become so bushy as to require cutting. The lashes are

set at the terminations of small blood-vessels. For the vessels come

to an end where the skin itself terminates; and, in all places where

these endings occur, the exudation of moisture of a corporeal

character necessitates the growth of hairs, unless there be some

operation of nature which interferes, by diverting the moisture to

another purpose.



                                16



  Viviparous quadrupeds, as a rule, present no great variety of form

in the organ of smell. In those of them, however, whose jaws project

forwards and taper to a narrow end, so as to form what is called a

snout, the nostrils are placed in this projection, there being no

other available plan; while, in the rest, there is a more definite

demarcation between nostrils and jaws. But in no animal is this part

so peculiar as in the elephant, where it attains an extraordinary

and strength. For the elephant uses its nostril as a hand; this

being the instrument with which it conveys food, fluid and solid

alike, to its mouth. With it, too, it tears up trees, coiling it round

their stems. In fact it applies it generally to the purposes of a

hand. For the elephant has the double character of a land animal,

and of one that lives in swamps. Seeing then that it has to get its

food from the water, and yet must necessarily breathe, inasmuch as

it is a land animal and has blood; seeing, also, that its excessive

weight prevents it from passing rapidly from water to land, as some

other sanguineous vivipara that breathe can do, it becomes necessary

that it shall be suited alike for life in the water and for life on

dry land. just then as divers are sometimes provided with

instruments for respiration, through which they can draw air from

above the water, and thus may remain for a long time under the sea, so

also have elephants been furnished by nature with their lengthened

nostril; and, whenever they have to traverse the water, they lift this

up above the surface and breathe through it. For the elephant's

proboscis, as already said, is a nostril. Now it would have been

impossible for this nostril to have the form of a proboscis, had it

been hard and incapable of bending. For its very length would then

have prevented the animal from supplying itself with food, being as

great an impediment as the of certain oxen, that are said to be

obliged to walk backwards while they are grazing. It is therefore soft

and flexible, and, being such, is made, in addition to its own

proper functions, to serve the office of the fore-feet; nature in this

following her wonted plan of using one and the same part for several

purposes. For in polydactylous quadrupeds the fore-feet are intended

not merely to support the weight of the body, but to serve as hands.

But in elephants, though they must be reckoned polydactylous, as their

foot has neither cloven nor solid hoof, the fore-feet, owing to the

great size and weight of the body, are reduced to the condition of

mere supports; and indeed their slow motion and unfitness for

bending make them useless for any other purpose. A nostril, then, is

given to the elephant for respiration, as to every other animal that

has a lung, and is lengthened out and endowed with its power of

coiling because the animal has to remain for considerable periods of

time in the water, and is unable to pass thence to dry ground with any

rapidity. But as the feet are shorn of their full office, this same

part is also, as already said, made by nature to supply their place,

and give such help as otherwise would be rendered by them.

  As to other sanguineous animals, the Birds, the Serpents, and the

Oviparous quadrupeds, in all of them there are the nostril-holes,

placed in front of the mouth; but in none are there any distinctly

formed nostrils, nothing in fact which can be called nostrils except

from a functional point of view. A bird at any rate has nothing

which can properly be called a nose. For its so-called beak is a

substitute for jaws. The reason for this is to be found in the natural

conformation of birds. For they are winged bipeds; and this makes it

necessary that their heads and neck shall be of light weight; just

as it makes it necessary that their breast shall be narrow. The beak

therefore with which they are provided is formed of a bone-like

substance, in order that it may serve as a weapon as well as for

nutritive purposes, but is made of narrow dimensions to suit the small

size of the head. In this beak are placed the olfactory passages.

But there are no nostrils; for such could not possibly be placed

there.

  As for those animals that have no respiration, it has already been

explained why it is that they are without nostrils, and perceive

odours either through gills, or through a blowhole, or, if they are

insects, by the hypozoma; and how the power of smelling depends,

like their motion, upon the innate spirit of their bodies, which in

all of them is implanted by nature and not introduced from without.

  Under the nostrils are the lips, in such sanguineous animals, that

is, as have teeth. For in birds, as already has been said, the

purposes of nutrition and defence are fulfilled by a bonelike beak,

which forms a compound substitute for teeth and lips. For supposing

that one were to cut off a man's lips, unite his upper teeth together,

and similarly his under ones, and then were to lengthen out the two

separate pieces thus formed, narrowing them on either side and

making them project forwards, supposing, I say, this to be done, we

should at once have a bird-like beak.

  The use of the lips in all animals except man is to preserve and

guard the teeth; and thus it is that the distinctness with which the

lips are formed is in direct proportion to the degree of nicety and

perfection with which the teeth are fashioned. In man the lips are

soft and flesh-like and capable of separating from each other. Their

purpose, as in other animals, is to guard the teeth, but they are more

especially intended to serve a higher office, contributing in common

with other parts to man's faculty of speech. For just as nature has

made man's tongue unlike that of other animals, and, in accordance

with what I have said is her not uncommon practice, has used it for

two distinct operations, namely for the perception of savours and

for speech, so also has she acted with regard to the lips, and made

them serve both for speech and for the protection of the teeth. For

vocal speech consists of combinations of the letters, and most of

these would be impossible to pronounce, were the lips not moist, nor

the tongue such as it is. For some letters are formed by closures of

the lips and others by applications of the tongue. But what are the

differences presented by these and what the nature and extent of

such differences, are questions to which answers must be sought from

those who are versed in metrical science. It was necessary that the

two parts which we are discussing should, in conformity with the

requirements, be severally adapted to fulfil the office mentioned

above, and be of appropriate character. Therefore are they made of

flesh, and flesh is softer in man than in any other animal, the reason

for this being that of all animals man has the most delicate sense

of touch.

  The tongue is placed under the vaulted roof of the mouth. In land

animals it presents but little diversity. But in other animals it is

variable, and this whethe+r we compare them as a class with such as

live on land, or compare their several species with each other. It

is in man that the tongue attains its greatest degree of freedom, of

softness, and of breadth; the object of this being to render it

suitable for its double function. For its softness fits it for the

perception of savours, a sense which is more delicate in man than in

any other animal, softness being most impressionable by touch, of

which sense taste is but a variety. This same softness again, together

with its breadth, adapts it for the articulation of letters and for

speech. For these qualities, combined with its freedom from

attachment, are those which suit it best for advancing and retiring in

every direction. That this is so is plain, if we consider the case

of those who are tongue-tied in however slight a degree. For their

speech is indistinct and lisping; that is to say there are certain

letters which they cannot pronounce. In being broad is comprised the

possibility of becoming narrow; for in the great the small is

included, but not the great in the small.

  What has been said explains why, among birds, those that are most

capable of pronouncing letters are such as have the broadest

tongues; and why the viviparous and sanguineous quadrupeds, where

the tongue is hard and thick and not free in its motions, have a

very limited vocal articulation. Some birds have a considerable

variety of notes. These are the smaller kinds. But it is the birds

with talons that have the broader tongues. All birds use their tongues

to communicate with each other. But some do this in a greater degree

than the rest; so that in some cases it even seems as though actual

instruction were imparted from one to another by its agency. These,

however, are matters which have already been discussed in the

Researches concerning Animals.

  As to those oviparous and sanguineous animals that live not in the

air but on the earth, their tongue in most cases is tied down and

hard, and is therefore useless for vocal purposes; in the serpents,

however, and in the lizards it is long and forked, so as to be

suited for the perception of savours. So long indeed is this part in

serpents, that though small while in the mouth it can be protruded

to a great distance. In these animals it is forked and has a fine

and hair-like extremity, because of their great liking for dainty

food. For by this arrangement they derive a twofold pleasure from

savours, their gustatory sensation being as it were doubled.

  Even some bloodless animals have an organ that serves for the

perception of savours; and in sanguineous animals such an organ is

invariably variably For even in such of these as would seem to an

ordinary observer to have nothing of the kind, some of the fishes

for example, there is a kind of shabby representative of a tongue,

much like what exists in river crocodiles. In most of these cases

the apparent absence of the part can be rationally explained on some

ground or other. For in the first place the interior of the mouth in

animals of this character is invariably spinous. Secondly, in water

animals there is but short space of time for the perception of

savours, and as the use of this sense is thus of short duration,

shortened also is the separate part which subserves it. The reason for

their food being so rapidly transmitted to the stomach is that they

cannot possibly spend any time in sucking out the juices; for were

they to attempt to do so, the water would make its way in during the

process. Unless therefore one pulls their mouth very widely open,

the projection of this part is quite invisible. The region exposed

by thus opening the mouth is spinous; for it is formed by the close

apposition of the gills, which are of a spinous character.

  In crocodiles the immobility of the lower jaw also contributes in

some measure to stunt the development of the tongue. For the

crocodile's tongue is adherent to the lower jaw. For its upper and

lower jaws are, as it were, inverted, it being the upper jaw which

in other animals is the immovable one. The tongue, however, on this

animal is not attached to the upper jaw, because that would

interfere with the ingestion of food, but adheres to the lower jaw,

because this is, as it were, the upper one which has changed its

place. Moreover, it is the crocodile's lot, though a land animal, to

live the life of a fish, and this again necessarily involves an

indistinct formation of the part in question.

  The roof of the mouth resembles flesh, even in many of the fishes;

and in some of the river species, as for instance in the fishes

known as Cyprini, is so very flesh-like and soft as to be taken by

careless observers for a tongue. The tongue of fishes, however, though

it exists as a separate part, is never formed with such distinctness

as this, as has been already explained. Again, as the gustatory

sensibility is intended to serve animals in the selection of food,

it is not diffused equally over the whole surface of the tongue-like

organ, but is placed chiefly in the tip; and for this reason it is the

tip which is the only part of the tongue separated in fishes from

the rest of the mouth. As all animals are sensible to the pleasure

derivable from food, they all feel a desire for it. For the object

of desire is the pleasant. The part, however, by which food produces

the sensation is not precisely alike in all of them, but while in some

it is free from attachments, in others, where it is not required for

vocal pur, poses, it is adherent. In some again it is hard, in

others soft or flesh-like. Thus even the Crustacea, the Carabi for

instance and the like, and the Cephalopods, such as the Sepias and the

Poulps, have some such part inside the mouth. As for the Insects, some

of them have the part which serves as tongue inside the mouth, as is

the case with ants, and as is also the case with many Testacea,

while in others it is placed externally. In this latter case it

resembles a sting, and is hollow and spongy, so as to serve at one and

the same time for the tasting and for the sucking up of nutriment.

This is plainly to be seen in flies and bees and all such animals, and

likewise in some of the Testacea. In the Purpurae, for instance, so

strong is this part that it enables them to bore holes through the

hard covering of shell-fish, of the spiral snails, for example, that

are used as bait to catch them. So also the gad-flies and cattle-flies

can pierce through the skin of man, and some of them even through

the skins of other animals. Such, then, in these animals is the nature

of the tongue, which is thus as it were the counterpart of the

elephant's nostril. For as in the elephant the nostril is used as a

weapon, so in these animals the tongue serves as a sting.

    In all other animals the tongue agrees with description already

given.
