  WE have next to consider the teeth, and with these the mouth, that

is the cavity which they enclose and form. The teeth have one

invariable office, namely the reduction of food; but besides this

general function they have other special ones, and these differ in

different groups. Thus in some animals the teeth serve as weapons; but

this with a distinction. For there are offensive weapons and there are

defensive weapons; and while in some animals, as the wild Carnivora,

the teeth answer both purposes, in many others, both wild and

domesticated, they serve only for defence. In man the teeth are

admirably constructed for their general office, the front ones being

sharp, so as to cut the food into bits, and the hinder ones broad

and flat, so as to grind it to a pulp; while between these and

separating them are the dog-teeth, which, in accordance with the

rule that the mean partakes of both extremes, share in the

characters of those on either side, being broad in one part but

sharp in another. Similar distinctions of shape are presented by the

teeth of other animals, with the exception of those whose teeth are

one and all of the sharp kind. In man, however, the number and the

character even of these sharp teeth have been mainly determined by the

requirements of speech. For the front teeth of man contribute in

many ways to the formation of letter-sounds.

  In some animals, however, the teeth, as already said, serve merely

for the reduction of food. When, besides this, they serve as offensive

and defensive weapons, they may either be formed into tusks, as for

instance is the case in swine, or may be sharp-pointed and interlock

with those of the opposite jaw, in which case the animal is said to be

saw-toothed. The explanation of this latter arrangement is as follows.

The strength of such an animal is in its teeth, and these depend for

their efficiency on their sharpness. In order, then, to prevent

their getting blunted by mutual friction, such of them as serve for

weapons fit into each other's interspaces, and are so kept in proper

condition. No animal that has sharp interfitting teeth is at the

same time furnished with tusks. For nature never makes anything

superfluous or in vain. She gives, therefore, tusks to such animals as

strike in fighting, and serrated teeth to such as bite. Sows, for

instance, have no tusks, and accordingly sows bite instead of

striking.

  A general principle must here be noted, which will be found

applicable not only in this instance but in many others that will

occur later on. Nature allots each weapon, offensive and defensive

alike, to those animals alone that can use it; or, if not to them

alone, to them in a more marked degree; and she allots it in its

most perfect state to those that can use it best; and this whether

it be a sting, or a spur, or horns, or tusks, or what it may of a like

kind.

  Thus as males are stronger and more choleric than females, it is

in males that such parts as those just mentioned are found, either

exclusively, as in some species, or more fully developed, as in

others. For though females are of course provided with such parts as

are no less necessary to them than to males, the parts, for

instance, which subserve nutrition, they have even these in an

inferior degree, and the parts which answer no such necessary

purpose they do not possess at all. This explains why stags have

horns, while does have none; why the horns of cows are different

from those of bulls, and, similarly, the horns of ewes from those of

rams. It explains also why the females are often without spurs in

species where the males are provided with them, and accounts for

similar facts relating to all other such parts.

  All fishes have teeth of the serrated form, with the single

exception of the fish known as the Scarus. In many of them there are

teeth even on the tongue and on the roof of the mouth. The reason

for this is that, living as they do in the water, they cannot but

allow this fluid to pass into the mouth with the food. The fluid

thus admitted they must necessarily discharge again without delay. For

were they not to do so, but to retain it for a time while

triturating the food, the water would run into their digestive

cavities. Their teeth therefore are all sharp, being adapted only

for cutting, and are numerous and set in many parts, that their

abundance may serve in lieu of any grinding faculty, to mince the food

into small bits. They are also curved, because these are almost the

only weapons which fishes possess.

  In all these offices of the teeth the mouth also takes its part; but

besides these functions it is subservient to respiration, in all

such animals as breathe and are cooled by external agency. For nature,

as already said, uses the parts which are common to all animals for

many special purposes, and this of her own accord. Thus the mouth

has one universal function in all animals alike, namely its alimentary

office; but in some, besides this, the special duty of serving as a

weapon is attached to it; in others that of ministering to speech; and

again in many, though not in all, the office of respiration. All these

functions are thrown by nature upon one single organ, the construction

of which she varies so as to suit the variations of office.

Therefore it is that in some animals the mouth is contracted, while in

others it is of wide dimensions. The contracted form belongs to such

animals as use the mouth merely for nutritive, respiratory, and

vocal purposes; whereas in such as use it as a means of defence it has

a wide gape. This is its invariable form in such animals as are

saw-toothed. For seeing that their mode of warfare consists in biting,

it is advantageous to them that their mouth shall have a wide opening;

for the wider it opens, the greater will be the extent of the bite,

and the more numerous will be the teeth called into play.

  What has just been said applies to fishes as well as to other

animals; and thus in such of them as are carnivorous, and made for

biting, the mouth has a wide gape; whereas in the rest it is small,

being placed at the extremity of a tapering snout. For this form is

suited for their purposes, while the other would be useless.

  In birds the mouth consists of what is called the beak, which in

them is a substitute for lips and teeth. This beak presents variations

in harmony with the functions and protective purposes which it serves.

Thus in those birds that are called Crooked-clawed it is invariably

hooked, inasmuch as these birds are carnivorous, and eat no kind of

vegetable food whatsoever. For this form renders it serviceable to

them in obtaining the mastery over their prey, and is better suited

for deeds of violence than any other. Moreover, as their weapons of

offence consist of this beak and of their claws, these latter also are

more crooked in them than in the generality of birds. Similarly in

each other kind of bird the beak is suited to the mode of life.

Thus, in woodpeckers it is hard and strong, as also in crows and birds

of crowlike habit, while in the smaller birds it is delicate, so as to

be of use in collecting seeds and picking up minute animals. In such

birds, again, as eat herbage, and such as live about marshes-those,

for example, that swim and have webbed feet-the bill is broad, or

adapted in some other way to the mode of life. For a broad bill

enables a bird to dig into the ground with ease, just as, among

quadrupeds, does the broad snout of the pig, an animal which, like the

birds in question, lives on roots. Moreover, in these root-eating

birds and in some others of like habits of life, the tips of the

bill end in hard points, which gives them additional facility in

dealing with herbaceous food.

  The several parts which are set on the head have now, pretty

nearly all, been considered. In man, however, the part which lies

between the head and the neck is called the face, this name,

(prosopon) being, it would seem, derived from the function of the

part. For as man is the only animal that stands erect, he is also

the only one that looks directly in front (proso) and the only one

whose voice is emitted in that direction.



                                 2



  We have now to treat of horns; for these also, when present, are

appendages of the head. They exist in none but viviparous animals;

though in some ovipara certain parts are metaphorically spoken of as

horns, in virtue of a certain resemblance. To none of such parts,

however, does the proper office of a horn belong; for they are never

used, as are the horns of vivipara, for purposes which require

strength, whether it be in self-protection or in offensive strife.

So also no polydactylous animal is furnished with horns. For horns are

defensive weapons, and these polydactylous animals possess other means

of security. For to some of them nature has given claws, to others

teeth suited for combat, and to the rest some other adequate defensive

appliance. There are horns, however, in most of the cloven-hoofed

animals, and in some of those that have a solid hoof, serving them

as an offensive weapon, and in some cases also as a defensive one.

There are horns also in all animals that have not been provided by

nature with some other means of security; such means, for instance, as

speed, which has been given to horses; or great size, as in camels;

for excessive bulk, such as has been given to these animals, and in

a still greater measure to elephants, is sufficient in itself to

protect an animal from being destroyed by others. Other animals

again are protected by the possession of tusks; and among these are

the swine, though they have a cloven hoof.

  All animals again, whose horns are but useless appendages, have been

provided by nature with some additional means of security. Thus deer

are endowed with speed; for the large size and great branching of

their horns makes these a source of detriment rather than of profit to

their possessors. Similarly endowed are the Bubalus and gazelle; for

though these animals will stand up against some enemies and defend

themselves with their horns, yet they run away from such as are fierce

and pugnacious. The Bonasus again, whoe horns curve inwards towards

each other, is provided with a means of protection in the discharge of

its excrement; and of this it avails itself when frightened. There are

some other animals besides the Bonasus that have a similar mode of

defence. In no case, however, does nature ever give more than one

adequate means of protection to one and the same animal.

  Most of the animals that have horns are cloven-hoofed; but the

Indian ass, as they call it, is also reported to be horned, though its

hoof is solid.

  Again as the body, so far as regards its organs of motion,

consists of two distinct parts, the right and the left, so also and

for like reasons the horns of animals are, in the great majority of

cases, two in number. Still there are some that have but a single

horn; the Oryx, for instance, and the so-called Indian ass; in the

former of which the hoof is cloven, while in the latter it is solid.

In such animals the horn is set in the centre of the head; for as

the middle belongs equally to both extremes, this arrangement is the

one that comes nearest to each side having its own horn.

  Again, it would appear consistent with reason that the single horn

should go with the solid rather than with the cloven hoof. For hoof,

whether solid or cloven, is of the same nature as horn; so that the

two naturally undergo division simultaneously and in the same animals.

Again, since the division of the cloven hoof depends on deficiency

of material, it is but rationally consistent, that nature, when she

gave an animal an excess of material for the hoofs, which thus

became solid, should have taken away something from the upper parts

and so made the animal to have but one horn. Rightly too did she act

when she chose the head whereon to set the horns; and AEsop's Momus is

beside the mark, when he finds fault with the bull for not having

its horns upon its shoulders. For from this position, says he, they

would have delivered their blow with the greatest force, whereas on

the head they occupy the weakest part of the whole body. Momus was but

dull-sighted in making this hostile criticism. For had the horns

been set on the shoulders, or had they been set on any other part than

they are, the encumbrance of their weight would have been increased,

not only without any compensating gain whatso::ver, but with the

disadvantage of impeding many bodily operations. For the point

whence the blows could be delivered with the greatest force was not

the only matter to be considered, but the point also whence they could

be delivered with the widest range. But as the bull has no hands and

cannot possibly have its horns on its feet or on its knees, where they

would prevent flexion, there remains no other site for them but the

head; and this therefore they necessarily occupy. In this position,

moreover, they are much less in the way of the movements of the body

than they would be elsewhere.

  Deer are the only animals in which the horns are solid throughout,

and are also the only animals that cast them. This casting is not

simply advantageous to the deer from the increased lightness which

it produces, but, seeing how heavy the horns are, is a matter of

actual necessity.

  In all other animals the horns are hollow for a certain distance,

and the end alone is solid, this being the part of use in a blow. At

the same time, to prevent even the hollow part from being weak, the

horn, though it grows out of the skin, has a solid piece from the

bones fitted into its cavity. For this arrangement is not only that

which makes the horns of the greatest service in fighting, but that

which causes them to be as little of an impediment as possible in

the other actions of life.

  Such then are the reasons for which horns exist; and such the

reasons why they are present in some animals, absent from others.

  Let us now consider the character of the material nature whose

necessary results have been made available by rational nature for a

final cause.

  In the first place, then, the larger the bulk of animals, the

greater is the proportion of corporeal and earthy matter which they

contain. Thus no very small animal is known to have horns, the

smallest horned animal that we are acquainted with being the

gazelle. But in all our speculations concerning nature, what we have

to consider is the general rule; for that is natural which applies

either universally or generally. And thus when we say that the largest

animals have most earthy matter, we say so because such is the general

rule. Now this earthy matter is used in the animal body to form

bone. But in the larger animals there is an excess of it, and this

excess is turned by nature to useful account, being converted into

weapons of defence. Part of it necessarily flows to the upper

portion of the body, and this is allotted by her in some cases to

the formation of tusks and teeth, in others to the formation of horns.

Thus it is that no animal that has horns has also front teeth in

both jaws, those in the upper jaw being deficient. For nature by

subtracting from the teeth adds to the horns; the nutriment which in

most animals goes to the former being here spent on the augmentation

of the latter. Does, it is true, have no horns and yet are equally

deficient with the males as regards the teeth. The reason, however,

for this is that they, as much as the males, are naturally

horn-bearing animals; but they have been stripped of their horns,

because these would not only be useless to them but actually

baneful; whereas the greater strength of the males causes these

organs, though equally useless, to be less of an impediment. In

other animals, where this material is not secreted from the body in

the shape of horns, it is used to increase the size of the teeth; in

some cases of all the teeth, in others merely of the tusks, which thus

become so long as to resemble horns projecting from the jaws.

  So much, then, of the parts which appertain to the head.



                                 3



  Below the head lies the neck, in such animals as have one. This is

the case with those only that have the parts to which a neck is

subservient. These parts are the larynx and what is called the

oesophagus. Of these the former, or larynx, exists for the sake of

respiration, being the instrument by which such animals as breathe

inhale and discharge the air. Therefore it is that, when there is no

lung, there is also no neck. Of this condition the Fishes are an

example. The other part, or oesophagus, is the channel through which

food is conveyed to the stomach; so that all animals that are

without a neck are also without a distinct oesophagus; Such a part

is in fact not required of necessity for nutritive purposes; for it

has no action whatsoever on the food. Indeed there is nothing to

prevent the stomach from being placed directly after the mouth.

This, however, is quite impossible in the case of the lung. For

there must be some sort of tube common to the two divisions of the

lung, by which--it being bipartite--the breath may be apportioned to

their respective bronchi, and thence pass into the air-pipes; and such

an arrangement will be the best for giving perfection to inspiration

and expiration. The organ then concerned in respiration must of

necessity be of some length; and this, again, necessitates there being

an oesophagus to unite mouth and stomach. This oesophagus is of a

flesh-like character, and yet admits of extension like a sinew. This

latter property is given to it, that it may stretch when food is

introduced; while the flesh-like character is intended to make it soft

and yielding, and to prevent it from being rasped by particles as they

pass downwards, and so suffering damage. On the other hand, the

windpipe and the so-called larynx are constructed out of a

cartilaginous substance. For they have to serve not only for

respiration, but also for vocal purposes; and an instrument that is to

produce sounds must necessarily be not only smooth but firm. The

windpipe lies in front of the oesophagus, although this position

causes it to be some hindrance to the latter in the act of

deglutition. For if a morsel of food, fluid or solid, slips into it by

accident, choking and much distress and violent fits of coughing

ensue. This must be a matter of astonishment to any of those who

assert that it is by the windpipe that an animal imbibes fluid. For

the consequences just mentioned occur invariably, whenever a

particle of food slips in, and are quite obvious. Indeed on many

grounds it is ridiculous to say that this is the channel through which

animals imbibe fluid. For there is no passage leading from the lung to

the stomach, such as the oesophagus which we see leading thither

from the mouth. Moreover, when any cause produces sickness and

vomiting, it is plain enough when the fluid is discharged. It is

manifest also that fluid, when swallowed, does not pass directly

into the bladder and collect there, but goes first into the stomach.

For, when red wine is taken, the dejections of the stomach are seen to

be coloured by its dregs; and such discoloration has been even seen on

many occasions inside the stomach itself, in cases where there have

been wounds opening into that organ. However, it is perhaps silly to

be minutely particular in dealing with silly statements such as this.

  The windpipe then, owing to its position in front of the oesophagus,

is exposed, as we have said, to annoyance from the food. To obviate

this, however, nature has contrived the epiglottis. This part is not

found in all sanguineous animals, but only in such of them as have a

lung; nor in all of these, but only in such as at the same time have

their skin covered with hairs, and not either with scaly plates or

with feathers. In such scaly and feathered animals there is no

epiglottis, but its office is supplied by the larynx, which closes and

opens, just as in the other case the epiglottis falls down and rises

up; rising up during the ingress or egress of breath, and falling down

during the ingestion of food, so as to prevent any particle from

slipping into the windpipe. Should there be the slightest want of

accuracy in this movement, or should an inspiration be made during the

ingestion of food, choking and coughing ensue, as already has been

noticed. So admirably contrived, however, is the movement both of

the epiglottis and of the tongue, that, while the food is being ground

to a pulp in the mouth, the tongue very rarely gets caught between the

teeth; and, while the food is passing over the epiglottis seldom

does a particle of it slip into the windpipe.

  The animals which have been mentioned as having no epiglottis owe

this deficiency to the dryness of their flesh and to the hardness of

their skin. For an epiglottis made of such materials would not admit

of easy motion. It would, indeed, take a longer time to shut down an

epiglottis made of the peculiar flesh of these animals, and shaped

like that of those with hairy skins, than to bring the edges of the

windpipe itself into contact with each other.

  Thus much then as to the reason why some animals have an

epiglottis while others have none, and thus much also as to its use.

It is a contrivance of nature to remedy the vicious position of the

windpipe in front of the oesophagus. That position is the result of

necessity. For it is in the front and centre of the body that the

heart is situated, in which we say is the principle of life and the

source of all motion and sensation. (For sensation and motion are

exercised in the direction which we term forwards, and it is on this

very relation that the distinction of before and behind is founded.)

But where the heart is, there and surrounding it is the lung. Now

inspiration, which occurs for the sake of the lung and for the sake of

the principle which has its seat in the heart, is effected through the

windpipe. Since then the heart must of necessity lie in the very front

place of all, it follows that the larynx also and the windpipe must of

necessity lie in front of the oesophagus. For they lead to the lung

and heart, whereas the oesophagus leads to the stomach. And it is a

universal law that, as regards above and below, front and back,

right and left, the nobler and more honourable part invariably is

placed uppermost, in front, and on the right, rather than in the

opposite positions, unless some more important object stands in the

way.



                                 4



  We have now dealt with the neck, the oesophagus, and the windpipe,

and have next to treat of the viscera. These are peculiar to

sanguineous animals, some of which have all of them, others only a

part, while no bloodless animals have any at all. Democritus then

seems to have been mistaken in the notion he formed of the viscera,

if, that is to say, he fancied that the reason why none were

discoverable in bloodless animals was that these animals were too

small to allow them to be seen. For, in sanguineous animals, both

heart and liver are visible enough when the body is only just

formed, and while it is still extremely small. For these parts are

to be seen in the egg sometimes as early as the third day, being

then no bigger than a point; and are visible also in aborted

embryos, while still excessively minute. Moreover, as the external

organs are not precisely alike in all animals, but each creature is

provided with such as are suited to its special mode of life and

motion, so is it with the internal parts, these also differing in

different animals. Viscera, then, are peculiar to sanguineous animals;

and therefore are each and all formed from sanguineous material, as is

plainly to be seen in the new-born young of these animals. For in such

the viscera are more sanguineous, and of greater bulk in proportion to

the body, than at any later period of life, it being in the earliest

stage of formation that the nature of the material and its abundance

are most conspicuous. There is a heart, then, in all sanguineous

animals, and the reason for this has already been given. For that

sanguineous animals must necessarily have blood is self-evident.

And, as the blood is fluid, it is also a matter of necessity that

there shall be a receptacle for it; and it is apparently to meet

this requirement that nature has devised the blood-vessels. These,

again, must necessarily have one primary source. For it is

preferable that there shall be one such, when possible, rather than

several. This primary source of the vessels is the heart. For the

vessels manifestly issue from it and do not go through it. Moreover,

being as it is homogeneous, it has the character of a blood-vessel.

Again its position is that of a primary or dominating part. For

nature, when no other more important purpose stands in her way, places

the more honourable part in the more honourable position; and the

heart lies about the centre of the body, but rather in its upper

than its lower half, and also more in front than behind. This is

most evident in the case of man, but even in other animals there is

a tendency in the heart to assume a similar position, in the centre of

the necessary part of the body, that is to say of the part which

terminates in the vent for excrement. For the limbs vary in position

in different animals, and are not to be counted with the parts which

are necessary for life. For life can be maintained even when they

are removed; while it is self-evident that the addition of them to

an animal is not destructive of it.

  There are some who say that the vessels commence in the head. In

this they are clearly mistaken. For in the first place, according to

their representation, there would be many sources for the vessels, and

these scattered; and secondly, these sources would be in a region that

is manifestly cold, as is shown by its intolerance of chill, whereas

the region of the heart is as manifestly hot. Again, as already

said, the vessels continue their course through the other viscera, but

no vessel spreads through the heart. From this it is quite evident

that the heart is a part of the vessels and their origin; and for this

it is well suited by its structure. For its central part consists of a

dense and hollow substance, and is moreover full of blood, as though

the vessels took thence their origin. It is hollow to serve for the

reception of the blood, while its wall is dense, that it may serve

to protect the source of heat. For here, and here alone in all the

viscera and indeed in all the body, there is blood without

blood-vessels, the blood elsewhere being always contained within

vessels. Nor is this but consistent with reason. For the blood is

conveyed into the vessels from the heart, but none passes into the

heart from without. For in itself it constitutes the origin and

fountain, or primary receptacle, of the blood. It is however, from

dissections and from observations on the process of development that

the truth of these statements receives its clearest demonstration. For

the heart is the first of all the parts to be formed; and no sooner is

it formed than it contains blood. Moreover, the motions of pain and

pleasure, and generally of all sensation, plainly have their source in

the heart, and find in it their ultimate termination. This, indeed,

reason would lead us to expect. For the source must, when. ever

possible, be one; and, of all places, the best suited for a source

is the centre. For the centre is one, and is equally or almost equally

within reach of every part. Again, as neither the blood itself, nor

yet any part which is bloodless, is endowed with sensation, it is

plain that that part which first has blood, and which holds it as it

were in a receptacle, must be the primary source of sensation. And

that this part is the heart is not only a rational inference, but also

evident to the senses. For no sooner is the embryo formed, than its

heart is seen in motion as though it were a living creature, and

this before any of the other parts, it being, as thus shown, the

starting-point of their nature in all animals that have blood. A

further evidence of the truth of what has been stated is the fact that

no sanguineous animal is without a heart. For the primary source of

blood must of necessity be present in them all. It is true that

sanguineous animals not only have a heart but also invariably have a

liver. But no one could ever deem the liver to be the primary organ

either of the whole body or of the blood. For the position in which it

is placed is far from being that of a primary or dominating part; and,

moreover, in the most perfectly finished animals there is another

part, the spleen, which as it were counterbalances it. Still

further, the liver contains no spacious receptacle in its substance,

as does the heart; but its blood is in a vessel as in all the other

viscera. The vessel, moreover, extends through it, and no vessel

whatsoever originates in it; for it is from the heart that all the

vessels take their rise. Since then one or other of these two parts

must be the central source, and since it is not the liver which is

such, it follows of necessity that it is the heart which is the source

of the blood, as also the primary organ in other respects. For the

definitive characteristic of an animal is the possession of sensation;

and the first sensory part is that which first has blood; that is to

say is the heart, which is the source of blood and the first of the

parts to contain it.

  The apex of the heart is pointed and more solid than the rest of the

organ. It lies against the breast, and entirely in the anterior part

of the body, in order to prevent that region from getting chilled. For

in all animals there is comparatively little flesh over the breast,

whereas there is a more abundant covering of that substance on the

posterior surface, so that the heat has in the back a sufficient

amount of protection. In all animals but man the heart is placed in

the centre of the pectoral region; but in man it inclines a little

towards the left, so that it may counterbalance the chilliness of that

side. For the left side is colder in man, as compared with the

right, than in any other animal. It has been stated in an earlier

treatise that even in fishes the heart holds the same position as in

other animals; and the reason has been given why it appears not to

do so. The apex of the heart, it is true, is in them turned towards

the head, but this in fishes is the front aspect, for it is the

direction in which their motion occurs.

  The heart again is abundantly supplied with sinews, as might

reasonably be expected. For the motions of the body commence from

the heart, and are brought about by traction and relaxation. The heart

therefore, which, as already said,' as it were a living creature

inside its possessor, requires some such subservient and strengthening

parts.

  In no animals does the heart contain a bone, certainly in none of

those that we have ourselves inspected, with the exception of the

horse and a certain kind of ox. In these exceptional cases the

heart, owing to its large bulk, is provided with a bone as a

support; just as the bones serve as supports for the body generally.

  In animals of great size the heart has three cavities; in smaller

animals it has two; and in all has at least one, for, as already

stated, there must be some place in the heart to serve as a receptacle

for the first blood; which, as has been mentioned more than once, is

formed in this organ. But inasmuch as the main blood-vessels are two

in number, namely the so-called great vessel and the aorta, each of

which is the origin of other vessels; inasmuch, moreover, as these two

vessels present differences, hereafter to be discussed, when

compared with each other, it is of advantage that they also shall

themselves have distinct origins. This advantage will be obtained if

each side have its own blood, and the blood of one side be kept

separate from that of the other. For this reason the heart, whenever

it is possible, has two receptacles. And this possibility exists in

the case of large animals, for in them the heart, as the body

generally, is of large size. Again it is still better that there shall

be three cavities, so that the middle and odd one may serve as a

centre common to both sides. But this requires the heart to be of

greater magnitude, so that it is only in the largest hearts that there

are three cavities.

  Of these three cavities it is the right that has the most abundant

and the hottest blood, and this explains why the limbs also on the

right side of the body are warmer than those on the left. The left

cavity has the least blood of all, and the coldest; while in the

middle cavity the blood, as regards quantity and heat, is intermediate

to the other two, being however of purer quality than either. For it

behoves the supreme part to be as tranquil as possible, and this

tranquillity can be ensured by the blood being pure, and of moderate

amount and warmth.

  In the heart of animals there is also a kind of joint-like division,

something like the sutures of the skull. This is not, however,

attributable to the heart being formed by the union of several parts

into a compound whole, but is rather, as already said, the result of a

joint-like division. These jointings are most distinct in animals of

keen sensibility, and less so in those that are of duller feeling,

in swine for instance. Different hearts differ also from each other in

their sizes, and in their degrees of firmness; and these differences

somehow extend their influence to the temperaments of the animals. For

in animals of low sensibility the heart is hard and dense in

texture, while it is softer in such as are endowed with keener

feeling. So also when the heart is of large size the animal is

timorous, while it is more courageous if the organ be smaller and of

moderate bulk. For in the former the bodily affection which results

from terror already pre-exists; for the bulk of the heart is out of

all proportion to the animal's heat, which being small is reduced to

insignificance in the large space, and thus the blood is made colder

than it would otherwise be.

  The heart is of large size in the hare, the deer, the mouse, the

hyena, the ass, the leopard, the marten, and in pretty nearly all

other animals that either are manifestly timorous, or betray their

cowardice by their spitefulness.

  What has been said of the heart as a whole is no less true of its

cavities and of the blood-vessels; these also if of large size being

cold. For just as a fire of equal size gives less heat in a large room

than in a small one, so also does the heat in a large cavity or a

large blood-vessel, that is in a large receptacle, have less effect

than in a small one. Moreover, all hot bodies are cooled by motions

external to themselves, and the more spacious the cavities and vessels

are, the greater the amount of spirit they contain, and the more

potent its action. Thus it is that no animal that has large cavities

in its heart, or large blood-vessels, is ever fat, the vessels being

indistinct and the cavities small in all or most fat animals.

  The heart again is the only one of the viscera, and indeed the

only part of the body, that is unable to tolerate any serious

affection. This is but what might reasonably be expected. For, if

the primary or dominant part be diseased, there is nothing from

which the other parts which depend upon it can derive succour. A proof

that the heart is thus unable to tolerate any morbid affection is

furnished by the fact that in no sacrificial victim has it ever been

seen to be affected with those diseases that are observable in the

other viscera. For the kidneys are frequently found to be full of

stones, and growths, and small abscesses, as also are the liver, the

lung, and more than all the spleen. There are also many other morbid

conditions which are seen to occur in these parts, those which are

least liable to such being the portion of the lung which is close to

the windpipe, and the portion of the liver which lies about the

junction with the great blood-vessel. This again admits of a

rational explanation. For it is in these parts that the lung and liver

are most closely in communion with the heart. On the other hand,

when animals die not by sacrifice but from disease, and from

affections such as are mentioned above, they are found on dissection

to have morbid affections of the heart.

  Thus much of the heart, its nature, and the end and cause of its

existence in such animals as have it.



                                 5



  In due sequence we have next to discuss the blood-vessels, that is

to say the great vessel and the aorta. For it is into these two that

the blood first passes when it quits the heart; and all the other

vessels are but offshoots from them. Now that these vessels exist on

account of the blood has already been stated. For every fluid requires

a receptacle, and in the case of the blood the vessels are that

receptacle. Let us now explain why these vessels are two, and why they

spring from one single source, and extend throughout the whole body.

  The reason, then, why these two vessels coalesce into one centre,

and spring from one source, is that the sensory soul is in all animals

actually one; and this one-ness of the sensory soul determines a

corresponding one-ness of the part in which it primarily abides. In

sanguineous animals this one-ness is not only actual but potential,

whereas in some bloodless animals it is only actual. Where, however,

the sensory soul is lodged, there also and in the selfsame place

must necessarily be the source of heat; and, again, where this is

there also must be the source of the blood, seeing that it thence

derives its warmth and fluidity. Thus, then, in the oneness of the

part in which is lodged the prime source of sensation and of heat is

involved the one-ness of the source in which the blood originates; and

this, again, explains why the blood-vessels have one common

starting-point.

  The vessels, again, are two, because the body of every sanguineous

animal that is capable of locomotion is bilateral; for in all such

animals there is a distinguishable before and behind, a right and

left, an above and below. Now as the front is more honourable and of

higher supremacy than the hinder aspect, so also and in like degree is

the great vessel superior to the aorta. For the great vessel is placed

in front, while the aorta is behind; the former again is plainly

visible in all sanguineous animals, while the latter is in some

indistinct and in some not discernible at all.

  Lastly, the reason for the vessels being distributed throughout

the entire body is that in them, or in parts analogous to them, is

contained the blood, or the fluid which in bloodless animals takes the

place of blood, and that the blood or analogous fluid is the

material from which the whole body is made. Now as to the manner in

which animals are nourished, and as to the source from which they

obtain nutriment and as to the way in which they absorb this from

the stomach, these are matters which may be more suitably considered

and explained in the treatise on Generation. But inasmuch as the parts

are, as already said, formed out of the blood, it is but rational that

the flow of the blood should extend, as it does, throughout the

whole of the body. For since each part is formed of blood, each must

have blood about and in its substance.

  To give an illustration of this. The water-courses in gardens are so

constructed as to distribute water from one single source or fount

into numerous channels, which divide and subdivide so as to convey

it to all parts; and, again, in house-building stones are thrown

down along the whole ground-plan of the foundation walls; because

the garden-plants in the one case grow at the expense of the water,

and the foundation walls in the other are built out of the stones. Now

just after the same fashion has nature laid down channels for the

conveyance of the blood throughout the whole body, because this

blood is the material out of which the whole fabric is made. This

becomes very evident in bodies that have undergone great emaciation.

For in such there is nothing to be seen but the blood-vessels; just as

when fig-leaves or vine-leaves or the like have dried up, there is

nothing left of them but their vessels. The explanation of this is

that the blood, or fluid which takes its place, is potentially body

and flesh, or substance analogous to flesh. Now just as in

irrigation the largest dykes are permanent, while the smallest are

soon filled up with mud and disappear, again to become visible when

the deposit of mud ceases; so also do the largest blood-vessels remain

permanently open, while the smallest are converted actually into

flesh, though potentially they are no whit less vessels than before.

This too explains why, so long as the flesh of an animal is in its

integrity, blood will flow from any part of it whatsoever that is cut,

though no vessel, however small, be visible in it. Yet there can be no

blood, unless there be a blood-vessel. The vessels then are there, but

are invisible owing to their being clogged up, just as the dykes for

irrigation are invisible until they have been cleared of mud.

  As the blood-vessels advance, they become gradually smaller and

smaller, until at last their tubes are too fine to admit the blood.

This fluid can therefore no longer find its way through them, though

they still give passage to the humour which we call sweat; and

especially so when the body is heated, and the mouths of the small

vessels are dilated. Instances, indeed, are not unknown of persons who

in consequence of a cachectic state have secreted sweat that resembled

blood, their body having become loose and flabby, and their blood

watery, owing to the heat in the small vessels having been too

scanty for its concoction. For, as was before said, every compound

of earth and water-and both nutriment and blood are such-becomes

thicker from concoction. The inability of the heat to effect

concoction may be due either to its being absolutely small in

amount, or to its being small in proportion to the quantity of food,

when this has been taken excess. This excess again may be of two

kinds, either quantitative or qualitative; for all substances are

not equally amenable to concoction.

  The widest passages in the body are of all parts the most liable

to haemorrhage; so that bleeding occurs not infrequently from the

nostrils, the gums, and the fundament, occasionally also from the

mouth. Such haemorrhages are of a passive kind, and not violent as are

those from the windpipe.

  The great vessel and the aorta, which above lie somewhat apart,

lower down exchange positions, and by so doing give compactness to the

body. For when they reach the point where the legs diverge, they

each split into two, and the great vessel passes from the front to the

rear, and the aorta from the rear to the front. By this they

contribute to the unity of the whole fabric. For as in plaited work

the parts hold more firmly together because of the interweaving, so

also by the interchange of position between the blood-vessels are

the anterior and posterior parts of the body more closely knit

together. A similar exchange of position occurs also in the upper part

of the body, between the vessels that have issued from the heart.

The details however of the mutual relations of the different vessels

must be looked for in the treatises on Anatomy and the Researches

concerning Animals.

  So much, then, as concerns the heart and the blood-vessels. We

must now pass on to the other viscera and apply the same method of

inquiry to them.



                                 6



  The lung, then, is an organ found in all the animals of a certain

class, because they live on land. For there must of necessity be

some means or other of tempering the heat of the body; and in

sanguineous animals, as they are of an especially hot nature, the

cooling agency must be external, whereas in the bloodless kinds the

innate spirit is sufficient of itself for the purpose. The external

cooling agent must be either air or water. In fishes the agent is

water. Fishes therefore never have a lung, but have gills in its

place, as was stated in the treatise on Respiration. But animals

that breathe are cooled by air. These therefore are all provided

with a lung.

  All land animals breathe, and even some water animals, such as the

whale, the dolphin, and all the spouting Cetacea. For many animals lie

half-way between terrestrial and aquatic; some that are terrestrial

and that inspire air being nevertheless of such a bodily

constitution that they abide for the most time in the water; and

some that are aquatic partaking so largely of the land character, that

respiration constitutes for them the man condition of life.

  The organ of respiration is the lung. This derives its motion from

the heart; but it is its own large size and spongy texture that

affords amplitude of space for entrance of the breath. For when the

lung rises up the breath streams in, and is again expelled when the

lung collapses. It has been said that the lung exists as a provision

to meet the jumping of the heart. But this is out of the question. For

man is practically the only animal whose heart presents this

phenomenon of jumping, inasmuch as he alone is influenced by hope

and anticipation of the future. Moreover, in most animals the lung

is separated from the heart by a considerable interval and lies

above it, so that it can contribute nothing to mitigate any jumping.

  The lung differs much in different animals. For in some it is of

large size and contains blood; while in others it is smaller and of

spongy texture. In the vivipara it is large and rich in blood, because

of their natural heat; while in the ovipara it is small and dry but

capable of expanding to a vast extent when inflated. Among terrestrial

animals, the oviparous quadrupeds, such as lizards, tortoises, and the

like, have this kind of lung; and, among inhabitants of the air, the

animals known as birds. For in all these the lung is spongy, and

like foam. For it is membranous and collapses from a large bulk to a

small one, as does foam when it runs together. In this too lies the

explanation of the fact that these animals are little liable to thirst

and drink but sparingly, and that they are able to remain for a

considerable time under water. For, inasmuch as they have but little

heat, the very motion of the lung, airlike and void, suffices by

itself to cool them for a considerable period.

  These animals, speaking generally, are also distinguished from

others by their smaller bulk. For heat promotes growth, and

abundance of blood is a sure indication of heat. Heat, again, tends to

make the body erect; and thus it is that man is the most erect of

animals, and the vivipara more erect than other quadrupeds. For no

viviparous animal, be it apodous or be it possessed of feet, is so

given to creep into holes as are the ovipara.

  The lung, then, exists for respiration; and this is its universal

office; but in one order of animals it is bloodless and has the

structure described above, to suit the special requirements There

is, however, no one term to denote all animals that have a lung; no

designation, that is, like the term Bird, applicable to the whole of a

certain class. Yet the possession of a lung is a part of their

essence, just as much as the presence of certain characters

constitutes the essence of a bird.



                                 7



  Of the viscera some appear to be single, as the heart and lung;

others to be double, as the kidneys; while of a third kind it is

doubtful in which class they should be reckoned. For the liver and the

spleen would seem to lie half-way between the single and the double

organs. For they may be regarded either as constituting each a

single organ, or as a pair of organs resembling each other in

character.

  In reality, however, all the organs are double. The reason for

this is that the body itself is double, consisting of two halves,

which are however combined together under one supreme centre. For

there is an upper and a lower half, a front and a rear, a right side

and a left.

  This explains why it is that even the brain and the several organs

of sense tend in all animals to consist of two parts; and the same

explanation applies to the heart with its cavities. The lung again

in Ovipara is divided to such an extent that these animals look as

though they had actually two lungs. As to the kidneys, no one can

overlook their double character. But when we come to the liver and the

spleen, any one might fairly be in doubt. The reason of this is, that,

in animals that necessarily have a spleen, this organ is such that

it might be taken for a kind of bastard liver; while in those in which

a spleen is not an actual necessity but is merely present, as it were,

by way of token, in an extremely minute form, the liver plainly

consists of two parts; of which the larger tends to lie on the right

side and the smaller on the left. Not but what there are some even

of the Ovipara in which this condition is comparatively indistinctly

marked; while, on the other hand, there are some Vivipara in which the

liver is manifestly divided into two parts. Examples of such

division are furnished by the hares of certain regions, which have the

appearance of having two livers, and by the cartilaginous and some

other fishes.

  It is the position of the liver on the right side of the body that

is the main cause for the formation of the spleen; the existence of

which thus becomes to a certain extent a matter of necessity in all

animals, though not of very stringent necessity.

  The reason, then, why the viscera are bilateral is, as we have said,

that there are two sides to the body, a right and a left. For each

of these sides aims at similarity with the other, and so likewise do

their several viscera; and as the sides, though dual, are knit

together into unity, so also do the viscera tend to be bilateral and

yet one by unity of constitution.

  Those viscera which lie below the diaphragm exist one and all on

account of the blood-vessels; serving as a bond, by which these

vessels, while floating freely, are yet held in connexion with the

body. For the vessels give off branches which run to the body

through the outstretched structures, like so many anchorlines thrown

out from a ship. The great vessel sends such branches to the liver and

the spleen; and these viscera-the liver and spleen on either side with

the kidneys behind-attach the great vessel to the body with the

firmness of nails. The aorta sends similar branches to each kidney,

but none to the liver or spleen.

  These viscera, then, contribute in this manner to the compactness of

the animal body. The liver and spleen assist, moreover, in the

concoction of the food; for both are of a hot character, owing to

the blood which they contain. The kidneys, on the other hand, take

part in the separation of the excretion which flows into the bladder.

  The heart then and the liver are essential constituents of every

animal; the liver that it may effect concoction, the heart that it may

lodge the central source of heat. For some part or other there must be

which, like a hearth, shall hold the kindling fire; and this part must

be well protected, seeing that it is, as it were, the citadel of the

body.

  All sanguineous animals, then, need these two parts; and this

explains why these two viscera, and these two alone, are invariably

found in them all. In such of them, however, as breathe, there is also

as invariably a third, namely the lung. The spleen, on the other hand,

is not invariably present; and, in those animals that have it, is only

present of necessity in the same sense as the excretions of the

belly and of the bladder are necessary, in the sense, that is, of

being an inevitable concomitant. Therefore it is that in some

animals the spleen is but scantily developed as regards size. This,

for instance, is the case in such feathered animals as have a hot

stomach. Such are the pigeon, the hawk, and the kite. It is the case

also in oviparous quadrupeds, where the spleen is excessively

minute, and in many of the scaly fishes. These same animals are also

without a bladder, because the loose texture of their flesh allows the

residual fluid to pass through and to be applied to the formation of

feathers and scales. For the spleen attracts the residual humours from

the stomach, and owing to its bloodlike character is enabled to assist

in their concoction. Should, however, this residual fluid be too

abundant, or the heat of the spleen be too scanty, the body becomes

sickly from over-repletion with nutriment. Often, too, when the spleen

is affected by disease, the belly becomes hard owing to the reflux

into it of the fluid; just as happens to those who form too much

urine, for they also are liable to a similar diversion of the fluids

into the belly. But in those animals that have but little

superfluous fluid to excrete, such as birds and fishes, the spleen

is never large, and in some exists no more than by way of token. So

also in the oviparous quadrupeds it is small, compact, and like a

kidney. For their lung is spongy, and they drink but little, and

such superfluous fluid as they have is applied to the growth of the

body and the formation of scaly plates, just as in birds it is applied

to the formation of feathers.

  On the other hand, in such animals as have a bladder, and whose lung

contains blood, the spleen is watery, both for the reason already

mentioned, and also because the left side of the body is more watery

and colder than the right. For each of two contraries has been so

placed as to go together with that which is akin to it in another pair

of contraries. Thus right and left, hot and cold, are pairs of

contraries; and right is conjoined with hot, after the manner

described, and left with cold.

  The kidneys when they are present exist not of actual necessity, but

as matters of greater finish and perfection. For by their special

character they are suited to serve in the excretion of the fluid which

collects in the bladder. In animals therefore where this fluid is very

abundantly formed, their presence enables the bladder to perform its

proper office with greater perfection.

  Since then both kidneys and bladder exist in animals for one and the

same function, we must next treat of the bladder, though in so doing

we disregard the due order of succession in which the parts should

be enumerated. For not a word has yet been said of the midriff,

which is one of the parts that environ the viscera and therefore has

to be considered with them.



                                 8



  It is not every animal that has a bladder; those only being

apparently intended by nature to have one, whose lung contains

blood. To such it was but reasonable that she should give this part.

For the superabundance in their lung of its natural constituents

causes them to be the thirstiest of animals, and makes them require

a more than ordinary quantity not merely of solid but also of liquid

nutriment. This increased consumption necessarily entails the

production of an increased amount of residue; which thus becomes too

abundant to be concocted by the stomach and excreted with its own

residual matter. The residual fluid must therefore of necessity have a

receptacle of its own; and thus it comes to pass that all animals

whose lung contains blood are provided with a bladder. Those

animals, on the other hand, that are without a lung of this character,

and that either drink but sparingly owing to their lung being of a

spongy texture, or never imbibe fluid at all for drinking's sake but

only as nutriment, insects for instance and fishes, and that are

moreover clad with feathers or scales or scaly plates-all these

animals, owing to the small amount of fluid which they imbibe, and

owing also to such residue as there may be being converted into

feathers and the like, are invariably without a bladder. The

Tortoises, which are comprised among animals with scaly plates, form

the only exception; and this is merely due to the imperfect

development of their natural conformation; the explanation of the

matter being that in the sea-tortoises the lung is flesh-like and

contains blood, resembling the lung of the ox, and that in the

land-tortoises it is of disproportionately large size. Moreover,

inasmuch as the covering which invests them is dense and shell-like,

so that the moisture cannot exhale through the porous flesh, as it

does in birds and in snakes and other animals with scaly plates,

such an amount of secretion is formed that some special part is

required to receive and hold it. This then is the reason why these

animals, alone of their kind, have a bladder, the sea-tortoise a large

one, the land-tortoises an extremely small one.



                                 9



  What has been said of the bladder is equally true of the kidneys.

For these also are wanting in all animals that are clad with

feathers or with scales or with scale-like plates; the sea and land

tortoises forming the only exception. In some of the birds, however,

there are flattened kidney like bodies, as though the flesh allotted

to the formation of the kidneys, unable to find one single place of

sufficient size, had been scattered over several.

  The Emys has neither bladder nor kidneys. For the softness of its

shell allows of the ready transpiration of fluid; and for this

reason neither of the organs mentioned exists in this animal. All

other animals, however, whose lung contains blood are, as before said,

provided with kidneys. For nature uses these organs for two separate

purposes, namely for the excretion of the residual fluid, and to

subserve the blood-vessels, a channel leading to them from the great

vessel.

  In the centre of the kidney is a cavity of variable size. This is

the case in all animals, excepting the seal. The kidneys of this

animal are more solid than those of any other, and in form resemble

the kidneys of the ox. The human kidneys are of similar shape; being

as it were made up of numerous small kidneys, and not presenting one

unbroken surface like the kidneys of sheep and other quadrupeds. For

this reason, should the kidneys of a man be once attacked by

disease, the malady is not easily expelled. For it is as though many

kidneys were diseased and not merely one; which naturally enhances the

difficulties of a cure.

  The duct which runs to the kidney from the great vessel does not

terminate in the central cavity, but is expended on the substance of

the organ, so that there is no blood in the cavity, nor is any

coagulum found there after death. A pair of stout ducts, void of

blood, run, one from the cavity of each kidney, to the bladder; and

other ducts, strong and continuous, lead into the kidneys from the

aorta. The purpose of this arrangement is to allow the superfluous

fluid to pass from the blood-vessel into the kidney, and the resulting

renal excretion to collect by the percolation of the fluid through the

solid substance of the organ, in its centre, where as a general rule

there is a cavity. (This by the way explains why the kidney is the

most ill-savoured of all the viscera.) From the central cavity the

fluid is discharged into the bladder by the ducts that have been

mentioned, having already assumed in great degree the character of

excremental residue. The bladder is as it were moored to the

kidneys; for, as already has been stated, it is attached to them by

strong ducts. These then are the purposes for which the kidneys exist,

and such the functions of these organs.

  In all animals that have kidneys, that on the right is placed higher

than that on the left. For inasmuch as motion commences from the

right, and the organs on this side are in consequence stronger than

those on the left, they must all push upwards in advance of their

opposite fellows; as may be seen in the fact that men even raise the

right eyebrow more than the left, and that the former is more arched

than the latter. The right kidney being thus drawn upwards is in all

animals brought into contact with the liver; for the liver lies on the

right side.

  Of all the viscera the kidneys are those that have the most fat.

This is in the first place the result of necessity, because the

kidneys are the parts through which the residual matters percolate.

For the blood which is left behind after this excretion, being of pure

quality, is of easy concoction, and the final result of thorough

blood-concoction is lard and suet. For just as a certain amount of

fire is left in the ashes of solid substances after combustion, so

also does a remnant of the heat that has been developed remain in

fluids after concoction; and this is the reason why oily matter is

light, and floats on the surface of other fluids. The fat is not

formed in the kidneys themselves, the density of their substance

forbidding this, but is deposited about their external surface. It

consists of lard or of suet, according as the animal's fat is of the

former or latter character. The difference between these two kinds

of fat has already been set forth in other passages. The formation,

then, of fat in the kidneys is the result of necessity; being, as

explained, a consequence of the necessary conditions which accompany

the possession of such organs. But at the same time the fat has a

final cause, namely to ensure the safety of the kidneys, and to

maintain their natural heat. For placed, as these organs are, close to

the surface, they require a greater supply of heat than other parts.

For while the back is thickly covered with flesh, so as to form a

shield for the heart and neighbouring viscera, the loins, in

accordance with a rule that applies to all bendings, are destitute

of flesh; and fat is therefore formed as a substitute for it, so

that the kidneys may not be without protection. The kidneys, moreover,

by being fat are the better enabled to secrete and concoct their

fluid; for fat is hot, and it is heat that effects concoction.

  Such, then, are the reasons why the kidneys are fat. But in all

animals the right kidney is less fat than its fellow. The reason for

this is, that the parts on the right side are naturally more solid and

more suited for motion than those on the left. But motion is

antagonistic to fat, for it tends to melt it.

  Animals then, as a general rule, derive advantage from their kidneys

being fat; and the fat is often very abundant and extends over the

whole of these organs. But, should the like occur in the sheep,

death ensues. Be its kidneys, however, as fat as they may, they are

never so fat but that some part, if not in both at any rate in the

right one, is left free. The reason why sheep are the only animals

that suffer in this manner, or suffer more than others, is that in

animals whose fat is composed of lard this is of fluid consistency, so

that there is not the same chance in their case of wind getting shut

in and causing mischief. But it is to such an enclosure of wind that

rot is due. And thus even in men, though it is beneficial to them to

have fat kidneys, yet should these organs become over-fat and

diseased, deadly pains ensue. As to those animals whose fat consists

of suet, in none is the suet so dense as in the sheep, neither is it

nearly so abundant; for of all animals there is none in which the

kidneys become so soon gorged with fat as in the sheep. Rot, then,

is produced by the moisture and the wind getting shut up in the

kidneys, and is a malady that carries off sheep with great rapidity.

For the disease forthwith reaches the heart, passing thither by the

aorta and the great vessel, the ducts which connect these with the

kidneys being of unbroken continuity.



                                10



  We have now dealt with the heart and the lung, as also with the

liver, spleen, and kidneys. The latter are separated from the former

by the midriff or, as some call it, the Phrenes. This divides off

the heart and lung, and, as already said, is called Phrenes in

sanguineous animals, all of which have a midriff, just as they all

have a heart and a liver. For they require a midriff to divide the

region of the heart from the region of the stomach, so that the centre

wherein abides the sensory soul may be undisturbed, and not be

overwhelmed, directly food is taken, by its up-steaming vapour and

by the abundance of heat then superinduced. For it was to guard

against this that nature made a division, constructing the midriff

as a kind of partition-wall and fence, and so separated the nobler

from the less noble parts, in all cases where a separation of upper

from lower is possible. For the upper part is the more honourable, and

is that for the sake of which the rest exists; while the lower part

exists for the sake of the upper and constitutes the necessary element

in the body, inasmuch as it is the recipient of the food.

  That portion of the midriff which is near the ribs is fleshier and

stronger than the rest, but the central part has more of a

membranous character; for this structure conduces best to its strength

and its extensibility. Now that the midriff, which is a kind of

outgrowth from the sides of the thorax, acts as a screen to prevent

heat mounting up from below, is shown by what happens, should it,

owing to its proximity to the stomach, attract thence the hot and

residual fluid. For when this occurs there ensues forthwith a marked

disturbance of intellect and of sensation. It is indeed because of

this that the midriff is called Phrenes, as though it had some share

in the process of thinking (Phronein). in reality, however, it has

no part whatsoever itself in the matter, but, lying in close proximity

to organs that have, it brings about the manifest changes of

intelligence in question by acting upon them. This too explains why

its central part is thin. For though this is in some measure the

result of necessity, inasmuch as those portions of the fleshy whole

which lie nearest to the ribs must necessarily be fleshier than the

rest, yet besides this there is a final cause, namely to give it as

small a proportion of humour as possible; for, had it been made of

flesh throughout, it would have been more likely to attract and hold a

large amount of this. That heating of it affects sensation rapidly and

in a notable manner is shown by the phenomena of laughing. For when

men are tickled they are quickly set a-laughing, because the motion

quickly reaches this part, and heating it though but slightly

nevertheless manifestly so disturbs the mental action as to occasion

movements that are independent of the will. That man alone is affected

by tickling is due firstly to the delicacy of his skin, and secondly

to his being the only animal that laughs. For to be tickled is to be

set in laughter, the laughter being produced such a motion as

mentioned of the region of the armpit.

  It is said also that when men in battle are wounded anywhere near

the midriff, they are seen to laugh, owing to the heat produced by the

wound. This may possibly be the case. At any rate it is a statement

made by much more credible persons than those who tell the story of

the human head, how it speaks after it is cut off. For so some assert,

and even call in Homer to support them, representing him as alluding

to this when he wrote, 'His head still speaking rolled into the dust,'

instead of 'The head of the speaker'. So fully was the possibility

of such an occurrence accepted in Caria, that one of that country

was actually brought to trial under the following circumstances. The

priest of Zeus Hoplosmios had been murdered; but as yet it had not

been ascertained who was the assassin; when certain persons asserted

that they had heard the murdered man's head, which had been severed

from the body, repeat several times the words, 'Cercidas slew man on

mam.' Search was thereupon made and a man of those parts who bore

the name of Cercidas hunted out and put upon his trial. But it is

impossible that any one should utter a word when the windpipe is

severed and no motion any longer derived from the lung. Moreover,

among the Barbarians, where heads are chopped off with great rapidity,

nothing of the kind has ever yet occurred. Why, again, does not the

like occur in the case of other animals than man? For that none of

them should laugh, when their midriff is wounded, is but what one

would expect; for no animal but man ever laughs. So, too, there is

nothing irrational in supposing that the trunk may run forwards to a

certain distance after the head has been cut seeing that bloodless

animals at any rate can live, and that for a considerable time,

after decapitation, as has been set forth and explained in other

passages.

  The purposes, then, for which the viscera severally exist have now

been stated. It is of necessity upon the inner terminations of the

vessels that they are developed; for humour, and that of a bloody

character, cannot but exude at these points, and it is of this,

solidified and coagulated, that the substance of the viscera is

formed. Thus they are of a bloody character, and in substance resemble

each other while they differ from other parts.



                                11



  The viscera are enclosed each in a membrane. For they require some

covering to protect them from injury, and require, moreover, that this

covering shall be light. To such requirements membrane is well

adapted; for it is close in texture so as to form a good protection,

destitute of flesh so as neither to attract humour nor retain it,

and thin so as to be light and not add to the weight of the body. Of

the membranes those are the stoutest and strongest which invest the

heart and the brain; as is but consistent with reason. For these are

the parts which require most protection, seeing that they are the main

governing powers of life, and that it is to governing powers that

guard is due.



                                12



  Some animals have all the viscera that have been enumerated;

others have only some of them. In what kind of animals this latter

is the case, and what is the explanation, has already been stated.

Moreover, the self-same viscera present differences in different

possessors. For the heart is not precisely alike in all animals that

have one; nor, in fact, is any viscus whatsoever. Thus the liver is in

some animals split into several parts, while in others it is

comparatively undivided. Such differences in its form present

themselves even among those sanguineous animals that are viviparous,

but are more marked in fishes and in the oviparous quadrupeds, and

this whether we compare them with each other or with the Vivipara.

As for birds, their liver very nearly resembles that of the

Vivipara; for in them, as in these, it is of a pure and blood-like

colour. The reason of this is that the body in both these classes of

animals admits of the freest exhalation, so that the amount of foul

residual matter within is but small. Hence it is that some of the

Vivipara are without any gall-bladder at all. For the liver takes a

large share in maintaining the purity of composition and the

healthiness of the body. For these are conditions that depend

finally and in the main upon the blood, and there is more blood in the

liver than in any of the other viscera, the heart only excepted. On

the other hand, the liver of oviparous quadrupeds and fishes inclines,

as a rule, to a yellow hue, and there are even some of them in which

it is entirely of this bad colour, in accordance with the bad

composition of their bodies generally. Such, for instance, is the case

in the toad, the tortoise, and other similar animals.

  The spleen, again, varies in different animals. For in those that

have horns and cloven hoofs, such as the goat, the sheep, and the

like, it is of a rounded form; excepting when increased size has

caused some part of it to extend its growth longitudinally, as has

happened in the case of the ox. On the other hand, it is elongated

in all polydactylous animals. Such, for instance, is the case in the

pig, in man, and in the dog. While in animals with solid hoofs it is

of a form intermediate to these two, being broad in one part, narrow

in another. Such, for example, is its shape in the horse, the mule,

and the ass.

                                13



  The viscera differ from the flesh not only in the turgid aspect of

their substance, but also in position; for they lie within the body,

whereas the flesh is placed on the outside. The explanation of this is

that these parts partake of the character of blood-vessels, and that

while the former exist for the sake of the vessels, the latter

cannot exist without them.



                                14



  Below the midriff lies the stomach, placed at the end of the

oesophagus when there is one, and in immediate contiguity with the

mouth when the oesophagus is wanting. Continuous with this stomach

is what is called the gut. These parts are present in all animals, for

reasons that are self-evident. For it is a matter of necessity that an

animal shall receive the incoming food; and necessary also that it

shall discharge the same when its goodness is exhausted. This residual

matter, again, must not occupy the same place as the yet unconcocted

nutriment. For as the ingress of food and the discharge of the residue

occur at distinct periods, so also must they necessarily occur in

distinct places. Thus there must be one receptacle for the ingoing

food and another for the useless residue, and between these,

therefore, a part in which the change from one condition to the

other may be effected. These, however, are matters which will be

more suitably set forth when we come to deal with Generation and

Nutrition. What we have at present to consider are the variations

presented by the stomach and its subsidiary parts. For neither in size

nor in shape are these parts uniformly alike in all animals. Thus

the stomach is single in all such sanguineous and viviparous animals

as have teeth in front of both jaws. It is single therefore in all the

polydactylous kinds, such as man, dog, lion, and the rest; in all

the solid-hoofed animals also, such as horse, mule, ass; and in all

those which, like the pig, though their hoof is cloven, yet have front

teeth in both jaws. When, however, an animal is of large size, and

feeds on substances of so thorny and ligneous a character as to be

difficult of concoction, it may in consequence have several

stomachs, as for instance is the case with the camel. A similar

multiplicity of stomachs exists also in the horned animals; the reason

being that horn-bearing animals have no front teeth in the upper

jaw. The camel also, though it has no horns, is yet without upper

front teeth. The explanation of this is that it is more essential

for the camel to have a multiple stomach than to have these teeth. Its

stomach, then, is constructed like that of animals without upper front

teeth, and, its dental arrangements being such as to match its

stomach, the teeth in question are wanting. They would indeed be of no

service. Its food, moreover, being of a thorny character, and its

tongue necessarily made of a fleshy substance, nature uses the

earthy matter which is saved from the teeth to give hardness to the

palate. The camel ruminates like the horned animals, because its

multiple stomach resembles theirs. For all animals that have horns,

the sheep for instance, the ox, the goat, the deer, and the like, have

several stomachs. For since the mouth, owing to its lack of teeth,

only imperfectly performs its office as regards the food, this

multiplicity of stomachs is intended to make up for its

shortcomings; the several cavities receiving the food one from the

other in succession; the first taking the unreduced substances, the

second the same when somewhat reduced, the third when reduction is

complete, and the fourth when the whole has become a smooth pulp. Such

is the reason why there is this multiplicity of parts and cavities

in animals with such dentition. The names given to the several

cavities are the paunch, the honeycomb bag, the manyplies, and the

reed. How these parts are related to each other, in position and in

shape, must be looked for in the treatises on Anatomy and the

Researches concerning Animals.

  Birds also present variations in the part which acts as a

recipient of the food; and the reason for these variations is the same

as in the animals just mentioned. For here again it is because the

mouth fails to perform its office and fails even more completely-for

birds have no teeth at all, nor any instrument whatsoever with which

to comminute or grind down their food-it is, I say, because of this,

that in some of them what is called the crop precedes the stomach

and does the work of the mouth; while in others the oesophagus is

either wide throughout or a part of it bulges just before it enters

the stomach, so as to form a preparatory store-house for the unreduced

food; or the stomach itself has a protuberance in some part, or is

strong and fleshy, so as to be able to store up the food for a

considerable period and to concoct it, in spite of its not having been

ground into a pulp. For nature retrieves the inefficiency of the mouth

by increasing the efficiency and heat of the stomach. Other birds

there are, such, namely, as have long legs and live in marshes, that

have none of these provisions, but merely an elongated oesophagus. The

explanation of this is to be found in the moist character of their

food. For all these birds feed on substances easy of reduction, and

their food being moist and not requiring much concoction, their

digestive cavities are of a corresponding character.

  Fishes are provided with teeth, which in almost all of them are of

the sharp interfitting kind. For there is but one small section in

which it is otherwise. Of these the fish called Scarus (Parrot-fish)

is an example. And this is probably the reason why this fish

apparently ruminates, though no other fishes do so. For those horned

animals that have no front teeth in the upper jaw also ruminate.

  In fishes the teeth are all sharp; so that these animals can

divide their food, though imperfectly. For it is impossible for a fish

to linger or spend time in the act of mastication, and therefore

they have no teeth that are flat or suitable for grinding; for such

teeth would be to no purpose. The oesophagus again in some fishes is

entirely wanting, and in the rest is but short. In order, however,

to facilitate the concoction of the food, some of them, as the

Cestreus (mullet), have a fleshy stomach resembling that of a bird;

while most of them have numerous processes close against the

stomach, to serve as a sort of antechamber in which the food may be

stored up and undergo putrefaction and concoction. There is contrast

between fishes and birds in the position of these processes. For in

fishes they are placed close to the stomach; while in birds, if

present at all, they are lower down, near the end of the gut. Some

of the Vivipara also have processes connected with the lower part of

the gut which serve the same purpose as that stated above.

  The whole tribe of fishes is of gluttonous appetite, owing to the

arrangements for the reduction of their food being very imperfect, and

much of it consequently passing through them without undergoing

concoction; and, of all, those are the most gluttonous that have a

straight intestine. For as the passage of food in such cases is rapid,

and the enjoyment derived from it in consequence but brief, it follows

of necessity that the return of appetite is also speedy.

  It has already been mentioned that in animals with front teeth in

both jaws the stomach is of small size. It may be classed pretty

nearly always under one or other of two headings, namely as resembling

the stomach of the dog, or as resembling the stomach of the pig. In

the pig the stomach is larger than in the dog, and presents certain

folds of moderate size, the purpose of which is to lengthen out the

period of concoction; while the stomach of the dog is of small size,

not much larger in calibre than the gut, and smooth on the internal

surface.

  Not much larger, I say, than the gut; for in all animals after the

stomach comes the gut. This, like the stomach, presents numerous

modifications. For in some animals it is uniform, when uncoiled, and

alike throughout, while in others it differs in different portions.

Thus in some cases it is wider in the neighbourhood of the stomach,

and narrower towards the other end; and this explains by the way why

dogs have to strain so much in discharging their excrement. But in

most animals it is the upper portion that is the narrower and the

lower that is of greater width.

  Of greater length than in other animals, and much convoluted, are

the intestines of those that have horns. These intestines, moreover,

as also the stomach, are of ampler volume, in accordance with the

larger size of the body. For animals with horns are, as a rule,

animals of no small bulk, because of the thorough elaboration which

their food undergoes. The gut, except in those animals where it is

straight, invariably widens out as we get farther from the stomach and

come to what is called the colon, and to a kind of caecal

dilatation. After this it again becomes narrower and convoluted.

Then succeeds a straight portion which runs right on to the vent. This

vent is known as the anus, and is in some animals surrounded by fat,

in others not so. All these parts have been so contrived by nature

as to harmonize with the various operations that relate to the food

and its residue. For, as the residual food gets farther on and lower

down, the space to contain it enlarges, allowing it to remain

stationary and undergo conversion. Thus is it in those animals

which, owing either to their large size, or to the heat of the parts

concerned, require more nutriment, and consume more fodder than the

rest.

  Neither is it without a purpose, that, just as a narrower gut

succeeds to the upper stomach, so also does the residual food, when

its goodness is thoroughly exhausted, pass from the colon and the

ample space of the lower stomach into a narrower channel and into

the spiral coil. For so nature can regulate her expenditure and

prevent the excremental residue from being discharged all at once.

  In all such animals, however, as have to be comparatively moderate

in their alimentation, the lower stomach presents no wide and roomy

spaces, though their gut is not straight, but has a number of

convolutions. For amplitude of space causes desire for ample food, and

straightness of the intestine causes quick return of appetite. And

thus it is that all animals whose food receptacles are either simple

or spacious are of gluttonous habits, the latter eating enormously

at a meal, the former making meals at short intervals.

  Again, since the food in the upper stomach, having just been

swallowed, must of necessity be quite fresh, while that which has

reached the lower stomach must have had its juices exhausted and

resemble dung, it follows of necessity that there must also be some

intermediate part, in which the change may be effected, and where

the food will be neither perfectly fresh nor yet dung. And thus it

is that, in all such animals as we are now considering, there is found

what is called the jejunum; which is a part of the small gut, of the

gut, that is, which comes next to the stomach. For this jejunum lies

between the upper cavity which contains the yet unconcocted food and

the lower cavity which holds the residual matter, which by the time it

has got here has become worthless. There is a jejunum in all these

animals, but it is only plainly discernible in those of large size,

and this only when they have abstained from food for a certain time.

For then alone can one hit on the exact period when the food lies

half-way between the upper and lower cavities; a period which is

very short, for the time occupied in the transition of food is but

brief. In females this jejunum may occupy any part whatsoever of the

upper intestine, but in males it comes just before the caecum and

the lower stomach.

  What is known as rennet is found in all animals that have a multiple

stomach, and in the hare among animals whose stomach is single. In the

former the rennet neither occupies the large paunch, nor the honeycomb

bag, nor the terminal reed, but is found in the cavity which separates

this terminal one from the two first, namely in the so-called

manyplies. It is the thick character of their milk which causes all

these animals to have rennet; whereas in animals with a single stomach

the milk is thin, and consequently no rennet is formed. It is this

difference in thickness which makes the milk of horned animals

coagulate, while that of animals without horns does not. Rennet

forms in the hare because it feeds on herbage that has juice like that

of the fig; for juice of this kind coagulates the milk in the

stomach of the sucklings. Why it is in the manyplies that rennet is

formed in animals with multiple stomachs has been stated in the

Problems.
