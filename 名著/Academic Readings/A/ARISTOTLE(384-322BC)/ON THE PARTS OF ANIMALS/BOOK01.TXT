  EVERY systematic science, the humblest and the noblest alike,

seems to admit of two distinct kinds of proficiency; one of which

may be properly called scientific knowledge of the subject, while

the other is a kind of educational acquaintance with it. For an

educated man should be able to form a fair off-hand judgement as to

the goodness or badness of the method used by a professor in his

exposition. To be educated is in fact to be able to do this; and

even the man of universal education we deem to be such in virtue of

his having this ability. It will, however, of course, be understood

that we only ascribe universal education to one who in his own

individual person is thus critical in all or nearly all branches of

knowledge, and not to one who has a like ability merely in some

special subject. For it is possible for a man to have this

competence in some one branch of knowledge without having it in all.

  It is plain then that, as in other sciences, so in that which

inquires into nature, there must be certain canons, by reference to

which a hearer shall be able to criticize the method of a professed

exposition, quite independently of the question whether the statements

made be true or false. Ought we, for instance (to give an illustration

of what I mean), to begin by discussing each separate species-man,

lion, ox, and the like-taking each kind in hand inde. pendently of the

rest, or ought we rather to deal first with the attributes which

they have in common in virtue of some common element of their

nature, and proceed from this as a basis for the consideration of them

separately? For genera that are quite distinct yet oftentimes

present many identical phenomena, sleep, for instance, respiration,

growth, decay, death, and other similar affections and conditions,

which may be passed over for the present, as we are not yet prepared

to treat of them with clearness and precision. Now it is plain that if

we deal with each species independently of the rest, we shall

frequently be obliged to repeat the same statements over and over

again; for horse and dog and man present, each and all, every one of

the phenomena just enumerated. A discussion therefore of the

attributes of each such species separately would necessarily involve

frequent repetitions as to characters, themselves identical but

recurring in animals specifically distinct. (Very possibly also

there may be other characters which, though they present specific

differences, yet come under one and the same category. For instance,

flying, swimming, walking, creeping, are plainly specifically

distinct, but yet are all forms of animal progression.) We must, then,

have some clear understanding as to the manner in which our

investigation is to be conducted; whether, I mean, we are first to

deal with the common or generic characters, and afterwards to take

into consideration special peculiarities; or whether we are to start

straight off with the ultimate species. For as yet no definite rule

has been laid down in this matter. So also there is a like uncertainty

as to another point now to be mentioned. Ought the writer who deals

with the works of nature to follow the plan adopted by the

mathematicians in their astronomical demonstrations, and after

considering the phenomena presented by animals, and their several

parts, proceed subsequently to treat of the causes and the reason why;

or ought he to follow some other method? And when these questions

are answered, there yet remains another. The causes concerned in the

generation of the works of nature are, as we see, more than one. There

is the final cause and there is the motor cause. Now we must decide

which of these two causes comes first, which second. Plainly, however,

that cause is the first which we call the final one. For this is the

Reason, and the Reason forms the starting-point, alike in the works of

art and in works of nature. For consider how the physician or how

the builder sets about his work. He starts by forming for himself a

definite picture, in the one case perceptible to mind, in the other to

sense, of his end-the physician of health, the builder of a

house-and this he holds forward as the reason and explanation of

each subsequent step that he takes, and of his acting in this or

that way as the case may be. Now in the works of nature the good end

and the final cause is still more dominant than in works of art such

as these, nor is necessity a factor with the same significance in them

all; though almost all writers, while they try to refer their origin

to this cause, do so without distinguishing the various senses in

which the term necessity is used. For there is absolute necessity,

manifested in eternal phenomena; and there is hypothetical

necessity, manifested in everything that is generated by nature as

in everything that is produced by art, be it a house or what it may.

For if a house or other such final object is to be realized, it is

necessary that such and such material shall exist; and it is necessary

that first this then that shall be produced, and first this and then

that set in motion, and so on in continuous succession, until the

end and final result is reached, for the sake of which each prior

thing is produced and exists. As with these productions of art, so

also is it with the productions of nature. The mode of necessity,

however, and the mode of ratiocination are different in natural

science from what they are in the theoretical sciences; of which we

have spoken elsewhere. For in the latter the starting-point is that

which is; in the former that which is to be. For it is that which is

yet to be-health, let us say, or a man-that, owing to its being of

such and such characters, necessitates the pre-existence or previous

production of this and that antecedent; and not this or that

antecedent which, because it exists or has been generated, makes it

necessary that health or a man is in, or shall come into, existence.

Nor is it possible to track back the series of necessary antecedents

to a starting-point, of which you can say that, existing itself from

eternity, it has determined their existence as its consequent. These

however again, are matters that have been dealt with in another

treatise. There too it was stated in what cases absolute and

hypothetical necessity exist; in what cases also the proposition

expressing hypothetical necessity is simply convertible, and what

cause it is that determines this convertibility.

  Another matter which must not be passed over without consideration

is, whether the proper subject of our exposition is that with which

the ancient writers concerned themselves, namely, what is the

process of formation of each animal; or whether it is not rather, what

are the characters of a given creature when formed. For there is no

small difference between these two views. The best course appears to

be that we should follow the method already mentioned, and begin

with the phenomena presented by each group of animals, and, when

this is done, proceed afterwards to state the causes of those

phenomena, and to deal with their evolution. For elsewhere, as for

instance in house building, this is the true sequence. The plan of the

house, or the house, has this and that form; and because it has this

and that form, therefore is its construction carried out in this or

that manner. For the process of evolution is for the sake of the thing

Anally evolved, and not this for the sake of the process.

Empedocles, then, was in error when he said that many of the

characters presented by animals were merely the results of

incidental occurrences during their development; for instance, that

the backbone was divided as it is into vertebrae, because it

happened to be broken owing to the contorted position of the foetus in

the womb. In so saying he overlooked the fact that propagation implies

a creative seed endowed with certain formative properties. Secondly,

he neglected another fact, namely, that the parent animal

pre-exists, not only in idea, but actually in time. For man is

generated from man; and thus it is the possession of certain

characters by the parent that determines the development of like

characters in the child. The same statement holds good also for the

operations of art, and even for those which are apparently

spontaneous. For the same result as is produced by art may occur

spontaneously. Spontaneity, for instance, may bring about the

restoration of health. The products of art, however, require the

pre-existence of an efficient cause homogeneous with themselves,

such as the statuary's art, which must necessarily precede the statue;

for this cannot possibly be produced spontaneously. Art indeed

consists in the conception of the result to be produced before its

realization in the material. As with spontaneity, so with chance;

for this also produces the same result as art, and by the same

process.

  The fittest mode, then, of treatment is to say, a man has such and

such parts, because the conception of a man includes their presence,

and because they are necessary conditions of his existence, or, if

we cannot quite say this, which would be best of all, then the next

thing to it, namely, that it is either quite impossible for him to

exist without them, or, at any rate, that it is better for him that

they should be there; and their existence involves the existence of

other antecedents. Thus we should say, because man is an animal with

such and such characters, therefore is the process of his

development necessarily such as it is; and therefore is it

accomplished in such and such an order, this part being formed

first, that next, and so on in succession; and after a like fashion

should we explain the evolution of all other works of nature.

  Now that with which the ancient writers, who first philosophized

about Nature, busied themselves, was the material principle and the

material cause. They inquired what this is, and what its character;

how the universe is generated out of it, and by what motor

influence, whether, for instance, by antagonism or friendship, whether

by intelligence or spontaneous action, the substratum of matter

being assumed to have certain inseparable properties; fire, for

instance, to have a hot nature, earth a cold one; the former to be

light, the latter heavy. For even the genesis of the universe is

thus explained by them. After a like fashion do they deal also with

the development of plants and of animals. They say, for instance, that

the water contained in the body causes by its currents the formation

of the stomach and the other receptacles of food or of excretion;

and that the breath by its passage breaks open the outlets of the

nostrils; air and water being the materials of which bodies are

made; for all represent nature as composed of such or similar

substances.

  But if men and animals and their several parts are natural

phenomena, then the natural philosopher must take into consideration

not merely the ultimate substances of which they are made, but also

flesh, bone, blood, and all other homogeneous parts; not only these,

but also the heterogeneous parts, such as face, hand, foot; and must

examine how each of these comes to be what it is, and in virtue of

what force. For to say what are the ultimate substances out of which

an animal is formed, to state, for instance, that it is made of fire

or earth, is no more sufficient than would be a similar account in the

case of a couch or the like. For we should not be content with

saying that the couch was made of bronze or wood or whatever it

might be, but should try to describe its design or mode of composition

in preference to the material; or, if we did deal with the material,

it would at any rate be with the concretion of material and form.

For a couch is such and such a form embodied in this or that matter,

or such and such a matter with this or that form; so that its shape

and structure must be included in our description. For the formal

nature is of greater importance than the material nature.

  Does, then, configuration and colour constitute the essence of the

various animals and of their several parts? For if so, what Democritus

says will be strictly correct. For such appears to have been his

notion. At any rate he says that it is evident to every one what

form it is that makes the man, seeing that he is recognizable by his

shape and colour. And yet a dead body has exactly the same

configuration as a living one; but for all that is not a man. So

also no hand of bronze or wood or constituted in any but the

appropriate way can possibly be a hand in more than name. For like a

physician in a painting, or like a flute in a sculpture, in spite of

its name it will be unable to do the office which that name implies.

Precisely in the same way no part of a dead body, such I mean as its

eye or its hand, is really an eye or a hand. To say, then, that

shape and colour constitute the animal is an inadequate statement, and

is much the same as if a woodcarver were to insist that the hand he

had cut out was really a hand. Yet the physiologists, when they give

an account of the development and causes of the animal form, speak

very much like such a craftsman. What, however, I would ask, are the

forces by which the hand or the body was fashioned into its shape? The

woodcarver will perhaps say, by the axe or the auger; the

physiologist, by air and by earth. Of these two answers the

artificer's is the better, but it is nevertheless insufficient. For it

is not enough for him to say that by the stroke of his tool this

part was formed into a concavity, that into a flat surface; but he

must state the reasons why he struck his blow in such a way as to

effect this, and what his final object was; namely, that the piece

of wood should develop eventually into this or that shape. It is

plain, then, that the teaching of the old physiologists is inadequate,

and that the true method is to state what the definitive characters

are that distinguish the animal as a whole; to explain what it is both

in substance and in form, and to deal after the same fashion with

its several organs; in fact, to proceed in exactly the same way as

we should do, were we giving a complete description of a couch.

  If now this something that constitutes the form of the living

being be the soul, or part of the soul, or something that without

the soul cannot exist; as would seem to be the case, seeing at any

rate that when the soul departs, what is left is no longer a living

animal, and that none of the parts remain what they were before,

excepting in mere configuration, like the animals that in the fable

are turned into stone; if, I say, this be so, then it will come within

the province of the natural philosopher to inform himself concerning

the soul, and to treat of it, either in its entirety, or, at any rate,

of that part of it which constitutes the essential character of an

animal; and it will be his duty to say what this soul or this part

of a soul is; and to discuss the attributes that attach to this

essential character, especially as nature is spoken of in two

senses, and the nature of a thing is either its matter or its essence;

nature as essence including both the motor cause and the final

cause. Now it is in the latter of these two senses that either the

whole soul or some part of it constitutes the nature of an animal; and

inasmuch as it is the presence of the soul that enables matter to

constitute the animal nature, much more than it is the presence of

matter which so enables the soul, the inquirer into nature is bound on

every ground to treat of the soul rather than of the matter. For

though the wood of which they are made constitutes the couch and the

tripod, it only does so because it is capable of receiving such and

such a form.

  What has been said suggests the question, whether it is the whole

soul or only some part of it, the consideration of which comes

within the province of natural science. Now if it be of the whole soul

that this should treat, then there is no place for any other

philosophy beside it. For as it belongs in all cases to one and the

same science to deal with correlated subjects-one and the same

science, for instance, deals with sensation and with the objects of

sense-and as therefore the intelligent soul and the objects of

intellect, being correlated, must belong to one and the same

science, it follows that natural science will have to include the

whole universe in its province. But perhaps it is not the whole

soul, nor all its parts collectively, that constitutes the source of

motion; but there may be one part, identical with that in plants,

which is the source of growth, another, namely the sensory part, which

is the source of change of quality, while still another, and this

not the intellectual part, is the source of locomotion. I say not

the intellectual part; for other animals than man have the power of

locomotion, but in none but him is there intellect. Thus then it is

plain that it is not of the whole soul that we have to treat. For it

is not the whole soul that constitutes the animal nature, but only

some part or parts of it. Moreover, it is impossible that any

abstraction can form a subject of natural science, seeing that

everything that Nature makes is means to an end. For just as human

creations are the products of art, so living objects are manifest in

the products of an analogous cause or principle, not external but

internal, derived like the hot and the cold from the environing

universe. And that the heaven, if it had an origin, was evolved and is

maintained by such a cause, there is therefore even more reason to

believe, than that mortal animals so originated. For order and

definiteness are much more plainly manifest in the celestial bodies

than in our own frame; while change and chance are characteristic of

the perishable things of earth. Yet there are some who, while they

allow that every animal exists and was generated by nature,

nevertheless hold that the heaven was constructed to be what it is

by chance and spontaneity; the heaven, in which not the faintest

sign of haphazard or of disorder is discernible! Again, whenever there

is plainly some final end, to which a motion tends should nothing

stand in the way, we always say that such final end is the aim or

purpose of the motion; and from this it is evident that there must

be a something or other really existing, corresponding to what we call

by the name of Nature. For a given germ does not give rise to any

chance living being, nor spring from any chance one; but each germ

springs from a definite parent and gives rise to a definite progeny.

And thus it is the germ that is the ruling influence and fabricator of

the offspring. For these it is by nature, the offspring being at any

rate that which in nature will spring from it. At the same time the

offspring is anterior to the germ; for germ and perfected progeny

are related as the developmental process and the result. Anterior,

however, to both germ and product is the organism from which the

germ was derived. For every germ implies two organisms, the parent and

the progeny. For germ or seed is both the seed of the organism from

which it came, of the horse, for instance, from which it was

derived, and the seed of the organism that will eventually arise

from it, of the mule, for example, which is developed from the seed of

the horse. The same seed then is the seed both of the horse and of the

mule, though in different ways as here set forth. Moreover, the seed

is potentially that which will spring from it, and the relation of

potentiality to actuality we know.

  There are then two causes, namely, necessity and the final end.

For many things are produced, simply as the results of necessity. It

may, however, be asked, of what mode of necessity are we speaking when

we say this. For it can be of neither of those two modes which are set

forth in the philosophical treatises. There is, however, the third

mode, in such things at any rate as are generated. For instance, we

say that food is necessary; because an animal cannot possibly do

without it. This third mode is what may be called hypothetical

necessity. Here is another example of it. If a piece of wood is to

be split with an axe, the axe must of necessity be hard; and, if hard,

must of necessity be made of bronze or iron. Now exactly in the same

way the body, which like the axe is an instrument-for both the body as

a whole and its several parts individually have definite operations

for which they are made-just in the same way, I say, the body, if it

is to do its work, must of necessity be of such and such a

character, and made of such and such materials.

  It is plain then that there are two modes of causation, and that

both of these must, so far as possible, be taken into account in

explaining the works of nature, or that at any rate an attempt must be

made to include them both; and that those who fail in this tell us

in reality nothing about nature. For primary cause constitutes the

nature of an animal much more than does its matter. There are indeed

passages in which even Empedocles hits upon this, and following the

guidance of fact, finds himself constrained to speak of the ratio

(olugos) as constituting the essence and real nature of things.

Such, for instance, is the case when he explains what is a bone. For

he does not merely describe its material, and say it is this one

element, or those two or three elements, or a compound of all the

elements, but states the ratio (olugos) of their combination. As

with a bone, so manifestly is it with the flesh and all other

similar parts.

  The reason why our predecessors failed in hitting upon this method

of treatment was, that they were not in possession of the notion of

essence, nor of any definition of substance. The first who came near

it was Democritus, and he was far from adopting it as a necessary

method in natural science, but was merely brought to it, spite of

himself, by constraint of facts. In the time of Socrates a nearer

approach was made to the method. But at this period men gave up

inquiring into the works of nature, and philosophers diverted their

attention to political science and to the virtues which benefit

mankind.

  Of the method itself the following is an example. In dealing with

respiration we must show that it takes place for such or such a

final object; and we must also show that this and that part of the

process is necessitated by this and that other stage of it. By

necessity we shall sometimes mean hypothetical necessity, the

necessity, that is, that the requisite antecedants shall be there,

if the final end is to be reached; and sometimes absolute necessity,

such necessity as that which connects substances and their inherent

properties and characters. For the alternate discharge and re-entrance

of heat and the inflow of air are necessary if we are to live. Here we

have at once a necessity in the former of the two senses. But the

alternation of heat and refrigeration produces of necessity an

alternate admission and discharge of the outer air, and this is a

necessity of the second kind.

  In the foregoing we have an example of the method which we must

adopt, and also an example of the kind of phenomena, the causes of

which we have to investigate.



                                 2



  Some writers propose to reach the definitions of the ultimate

forms of animal life by bipartite division. But this method is often

difficult, and often impracticable.

  Sometimes the final differentia of the subdivision is sufficient

by itself, and the antecedent differentiae are mere surplusage. Thus

in the series Footed, Two-footed, Cleft-footed, the last term is

all-expressive by itself, and to append the higher terms is only an

idle iteration. Again it is not permissible to break up a natural

group, Birds for instance, by putting its members under different

bifurcations, as is done in the published dichotomies, where some

birds are ranked with animals of the water, and others placed in a

different class. The group Birds and the group Fishes happen to be

named, while other natural groups have no popular names; for instance,

the groups that we may call Sanguineous and Bloodless are not known

popularly by any designations. If such natural groups are not to be

broken up, the method of Dichotomy cannot be employed, for it

necessarily involves such breaking up and dislocation. The group of

the Many-footed, for instance, would, under this method, have to be

dismembered, and some of its kinds distributed among land animals,

others among water animals.



                                 3



  Again, privative terms inevitably form one branch of dichotomous

division, as we see in the proposed dichotomies. But privative terms

in their character of privatives admit of no subdivision. For there

can be no specific forms of a negation, of Featherless for instance or

of Footless, as there are of Feathered and of Footed. Yet a generic

differentia must be subdivisible; for otherwise what is there that

makes it generic rather than specific? There are to be found

generic, that is specifically subdivisible, differentiae; Feathered

for instance and Footed. For feathers are divisible into Barbed and

Unbarbed, and feet into Manycleft, and Twocleft, like those of animals

with bifid hoofs, and Uncleft or Undivided, like those of animals with

solid hoofs. Now even with differentiae capable of this specific

subdivision it is difficult enough so to make the classification, as

that each animal shall be comprehended in some one subdivision and

in not more than one; but far more difficult, nay impossible, is it to

do this, if we start with a dichotomy into two contradictories.

(Suppose for instance we start with the two contradictories, Feathered

and Unfeathered; we shall find that the ant, the glow-worm, and some

other animals fall under both divisions.) For each differentia must be

presented by some species. There must be some species, therefore,

under the privative heading. Now specifically distinct animals

cannot present in their essence a common undifferentiated element, but

any apparently common element must really be differentiated. (Bird and

Man for instance are both Two-footed, but their two-footedness is

diverse and differentiated. So any two sanguineous groups must have

some difference in their blood, if their blood is part of their

essence.) From this it follows that a privative term, being

insusceptible of differentiation, cannot be a generic differentia;

for, if it were, there would be a common undifferentiated element in

two different groups.

  Again, if the species are ultimate indivisible groups, that is,

are groups with indivisible differentiae, and if no differentia be

common to several groups, the number of differentiae must be equal

to the number of species. If a differentia though not divisible

could yet be common to several groups, then it is plain that in virtue

of that common differentia specifically distinct animals would fall

into the same division. It is necessary then, if the differentiae,

under which are ranged all the ultimate and indivisible groups, are

specific characters, that none of them shall be common; for otherwise,

as already said, specifically distinct animals will come into one

and the same division. But this would violate one of the requisite

conditions, which are as follows. No ultimate group must be included

in more than a single division; different groups must not be

included in the same division; and every group must be found in some

division. It is plain then that we cannot get at the ultimate specific

forms of the animal, or any other, kingdom by bifurcate division. If

we could, the number of ultimate differentiae would equal the number

of ultimate animal forms. For assume an order of beings whose prime

differentiae are White and Black. Each of these branches will

bifurcate, and their branches again, and so on till we reach the

ultimate differentiae, whose number will be four or some other power

of two, and will also be the number of the ultimate species

comprehended in the order.

  (A species is constituted by the combination differentia and matter.

For no part of an animal is purely material or purely immaterial;

nor can a body, independently of its condition, constitute an animal

or any of its parts, as has repeatedly been observed.)

  Further, the differentiae must be elements of the essence, and not

merely essential attributes. Thus if Figure is the term to be divided,

it must not be divided into figures whose angles are equal to two

right angles, and figures whose angles are together greater than two

right angles. For it is only an attribute of a triangle and not part

of its essence that its angles are equal to two right angles.

  Again, the bifurcations must be opposites, like White and Black,

Straight and Bent; and if we characterize one branch by either term,

we must characterize the other by its opposite, and not, for

example, characterize one branch by a colour, the other by a mode of

progression, swimming for instance.

  Furthermore, living beings cannot be divided by the functions common

to body and soul, by Flying, for instance, and Walking, as we see them

divided in the dichotomies already referred to. For some groups,

Ants for instance, fall under both divisions, some ants flying while

others do not. Similarly as regards the division into Wild and Tame;

for it also would involve the disruption of a species into different

groups. For in almost all species in which some members are tame,

there are other members that are wild. Such, for example, is the

case with Men, Horses, Oxen, Dogs in India, Pigs, Goats, Sheep; groups

which, if double, ought to have what they have not, namely,

different appellations; and which, if single, prove that Wildness

and Tameness do not amount to specific differences. And whatever

single element we take as a basis of division the same difficulty will

occur.

  The method then that we must adopt is to attempt to recognize the

natural groups, following the indications afforded by the instincts of

mankind, which led them for instance to form the class of Birds and

the class of Fishes, each of which groups combines a multitude of

differentiae, and is not defined by a single one as in dichotomy.

The method of dichotomy is either impossible (for it would put a

single group under different divisions or contrary groups under the

same division), or it only furnishes a single ultimate differentia for

each species, which either alone or with its series of antecedents has

to constitute the ultimate species.

  If, again, a new differential character be introduced at any stage

into the division, the necessary result is that the continuity of

the division becomes merely a unity and continuity of agglomeration,

like the unity and continuity of a series of sentences coupled

together by conjunctive particles. For instance, suppose we have the

bifurcation Feathered and Featherless, and then divide Feathered

into Wild and Tame, or into White and Black. Tame and White are not

a differentiation of Feathered, but are the commencement of an

independent bifurcation, and are foreign to the series at the end of

which they are introduced.

  As we said then, we must define at the outset by multiplicity of

differentiae. If we do so, privative terms will be available, which

are unavailable to the dichotomist.

  The impossibility of reaching the definition of any of the

ultimate forms by dichotomy of the larger group, as some propose, is

manifest also from the following considerations. It is impossible that

a single differentia, either by itself or with its antecedents,

shall express the whole essence of a species. (In saying a single

differentia by itself I mean such an isolated differentia as

Cleft-footed; in saying a single differentia with antecedent I mean,

to give an instance, Manycleft-footed preceded by Cleft-footed. The

very continuity of a series of successive differentiae in a division

is intended to show that it is their combination that expresses the

character of the resulting unit, or ultimate group. But one is

misled by the usages of language into imagining that it is merely

the final term of the series, Manycleft-footed for instance, that

constitutes the whole differentia, and that the antecedent terms,

Footed, Cleft-footed, are superfluous. Now it is evident that such a

series cannot consist of many terms. For if one divides and

subdivides, one soon reaches the final differential term, but for

all that will not have got to the ultimate division, that is, to the

species.) No single differentia, I repeat, either by itself or with

its antecedents, can possibly express the essence of a species.

Suppose, for example, Man to be the animal to be defined; the single

differentia will be Cleft-footed, either by itself or with its

antecedents, Footed and Two-footed. Now if man was nothing more than a

Cleft-footed animal, this single differentia would duly represent

his essence. But seeing that this is not the case, more differentiae

than this one will necessarily be required to define him; and these

cannot come under one division; for each single branch of a

dichotomy ends in a single differentia, and cannot possibly include

several differentiae belonging to one and the same animal.

  It is impossible then to reach any of the ultimate animal forms by

dichotomous division.



                                 4



  It deserves inquiry why a single name denoting a higher group was

not invented by mankind, as an appellation to comprehend the two

groups of Water animals and Winged animals. For even these have

certain attributes in common. However, the present nomenclature is

just. Groups that only differ in degree, and in the more or less of an

identical element that they possess, are aggregated under a single

class; groups whose attributes are not identical but analogous are

separated. For instance, bird differs from bird by gradation, or by

excess and defect; some birds have long feathers, others short ones,

but all are feathered. Bird and Fish are more remote and only agree in

having analogous organs; for what in the bird is feather, in the

fish is scale. Such analogies can scarcely, however, serve universally

as indications for the formation of groups, for almost all animals

present analogies in their corresponding parts.

  The individuals comprised within a species, such as Socrates and

Coriscus, are the real existences; but inasmuch as these individuals

possess one common specific form, it will suffice to state the

universal attributes of the species, that is, the attributes common to

all its individuals, once for all, as otherwise there will be

endless reiteration, as has already been pointed out.

  But as regards the larger groups-such as Birds-which comprehend many

species, there may be a question. For on the one hand it may be

urged that as the ultimate species represent the real existences, it

will be well, if practicable, to examine these ultimate species

separately, just as we examine the species Man separately; to examine,

that is, not the whole class Birds collectively, but the Ostrich,

the Crane, and the other indivisible groups or species belonging to

the class.

  On the other hand, however, this course would involve repeated

mention of the same attribute, as the same attribute is common to many

species, and so far would be somewhat irrational and tedious. Perhaps,

then, it will be best to treat generically the universal attributes of

the groups that have a common nature and contain closely allied

subordinate forms, whether they are groups recognized by a true

instinct of mankind, such as Birds and Fishes, or groups not popularly

known by a common appellation, but withal composed of closely allied

subordinate groups; and only to deal individually with the

attributes of a single species, when such species, man, for

instance, and any other such, if such there be-stands apart from

others, and does not constitute with them a larger natural group.

  It is generally similarity in the shape of particular organs, or

of the whole body, that has determined the formation of the larger

groups. It is in virtue of such a similarity that Birds, Fishes,

Cephalopoda, and Testacea have been made to form each a separate

class. For within the limits of each such class, the parts do not

differ in that they have no nearer resemblance than that of

analogy-such as exists between the bone of man and the spine of

fish-but differ merely in respect of such corporeal conditions as

largeness smallness, softness hardness, smoothness roughness, and

other similar oppositions, or, in one word, in respect of degree.

  We have now touched upon the canons for criticizing the method of

natural science, and have considered what is the most systematic and

easy course of investigation; we have also dealt with division, and

the mode of conducting it so as best to attain the ends of science,

and have shown why dichotomy is either impracticable or

inefficacious for its professed purposes.

  Having laid this foundation, let us pass on to our next topic.



                                 5



  Of things constituted by nature some are ungenerated,

imperishable, and eternal, while others are subject to generation

and decay. The former are excellent beyond compare and divine, but

less accessible to knowledge. The evidence that might throw light on

them, and on the problems which we long to solve respecting them, is

furnished but scantily by sensation; whereas respecting perishable

plants and animals we have abundant information, living as we do in

their midst, and ample data may be collected concerning all their

various kinds, if only we are willing to take sufficient pains. Both

departments, however, have their special charm. The scanty conceptions

to which we can attain of celestial things give us, from their

excellence, more pleasure than all our knowledge of the world in which

we live; just as a half glimpse of persons that we love is more

delightful than a leisurely view of other things, whatever their

number and dimensions. On the other hand, in certitude and in

completeness our knowledge of terrestrial things has the advantage.

Moreover, their greater nearness and affinity to us balances

somewhat the loftier interest of the heavenly things that are the

objects of the higher philosophy. Having already treated of the

celestial world, as far as our conjectures could reach, we proceed

to treat of animals, without omitting, to the best of our ability, any

member of the kingdom, however ignoble. For if some have no graces

to charm the sense, yet even these, by disclosing to intellectual

perception the artistic spirit that designed them, give immense

pleasure to all who can trace links of causation, and are inclined

to philosophy. Indeed, it would be strange if mimic representations of

them were attractive, because they disclose the mimetic skill of the

painter or sculptor, and the original realities themselves were not

more interesting, to all at any rate who have eyes to discern the

reasons that determined their formation. We therefore must not

recoil with childish aversion from the examination of the humbler

animals. Every realm of nature is marvellous: and as Heraclitus,

when the strangers who came to visit him found him warming himself

at the furnace in the kitchen and hesitated to go in, reported to have

bidden them not to be afraid to enter, as even in that kitchen

divinities were present, so we should venture on the study of every

kind of animal without distaste; for each and all will reveal to us

something natural and something beautiful. Absence of haphazard and

conduciveness of everything to an end are to be found in Nature's

works in the highest degree, and the resultant end of her

generations and combinations is a form of the beautiful.

  If any person thinks the examination of the rest of the animal

kingdom an unworthy task, he must hold in like disesteem the study

of man. For no one can look at the primordia of the human frame-blood,

flesh, bones, vessels, and the like-without much repugnance. Moreover,

when any one of the parts or structures, be it which it may, is

under discussion, it must not be supposed that it is its material

composition to which attention is being directed or which is the

object of the discussion, but the relation of such part to the total

form. Similarly, the true object of architecture is not bricks,

mortar, or timber, but the house; and so the principal object of

natural philosophy is not the material elements, but their

composition, and the totality of the form, independently of which they

have no existence.

  The course of exposition must be first to state the attributes

common to whole groups of animals, and then to attempt to give their

explanation. Many groups, as already noticed, present common

attributes, that is to say, in some cases absolutely identical

affections, and absolutely identical organs,-feet, feathers, scales,

and the like-while in other groups the affections and organs are

only so far identical as that they are analogous. For instance, some

groups have lungs, others have no lung, but an organ analogous to a

lung in its place; some have blood, others have no blood, but a

fluid analogous to blood, and with the same office. To treat of the

common attributes in connexion with each individual group would

involve, as already suggested, useless iteration. For many groups have

common attributes. So much for this topic.

  As every instrument and every bodily member subserves some partial

end, that is to say, some special action, so the whole body must be

destined to minister to some Plenary sphere of action. Thus the saw is

made for sawing, for sawing is a function, and not sawing for the saw.

Similarly, the body too must somehow or other be made for the soul,

and each part of it for some subordinate function, to which it is

adapted.

  We have, then, first to describe the common functions, common,

that is, to the whole animal kingdom, or to certain large groups, or

to the members of a species. In other words, we have to describe the

attributes common to all animals, or to assemblages, like the class of

Birds, of closely allied groups differentiated by gradation, or to

groups like Man not differentiated into subordinate groups. In the

first case the common attributes may be called analogous, in the

second generic, in the third specific.

  When a function is ancillary to another, a like relation

manifestly obtains between the organs which discharge these functions;

and similarly, if one function is prior to and the end of another,

their respective organs will stand to each other in the same relation.

Thirdly, the existence of these parts involves that of other things as

their necessary consequents.

  Instances of what I mean by functions and affections are

Reproduction, Growth, Copulation, Waking, Sleep, Locomotion, and other

similar vital actions. Instances of what I mean by parts are Nose,

Eye, Face, and other so-called members or limbs, and also the more

elementary parts of which these are made. So much for the method to be

pursued. Let us now try to set forth the causes of all vital

phenomena, whether universal or particular, and in so doing let us

follow that order of exposition which conforms, as we have

indicated, to the order of nature.
