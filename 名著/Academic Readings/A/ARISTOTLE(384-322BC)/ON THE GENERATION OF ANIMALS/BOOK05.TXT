  WE must now investigate the qualities by which the parts of

animals differ. I mean such qualities of the parts as blueness and

blackness in the eyes, height and depth of pitch in the voice, and

differences in colour whether of the skin or of hair and feathers.

Some such qualities are found to characterize the whole of a kind of

animals sometimes, while in other kinds they occur at random, as is

especially the case in man. Further, in connexion with the changes

in the time of life, all animals are alike in some points, but are

opposed in others as in the case of the voice and the colour of the

hair, for some do not grow grey visibly in old age, while man is

subject to this more than any other animal. And some of these

affections appear immediately after birth, while others become plain

as age advances or in old age.

  Now we must no longer suppose that the cause of these and all such

phenomena is the same. For whenever things are not the product of

Nature working upon the animal kingdom as a whole, nor yet

characteristic of each separate kind, then none of these things is

such as it is or is so developed for any final cause. The eye for

instance exists for a final cause, but it is not blue for a final

cause unless this condition be characteristic of the kind of animal.

In fact in some cases this condition has no connexion with the essence

of the animal's being, but we must refer the causes to the material

and the motive principle or efficient cause, on the view that these

things come into being by Necessity. For, as was said originally in

the outset of our discussion, when we are dealing with definite and

ordered products of Nature, we must not say that each is of a

certain quality because it becomes so, but rather that they become

so and so because they are so and so, for the process of Becoming or

development attends upon Being and is for the sake of Being, not

vice versa.

  The ancient Nature-philosophers however took the opposite view.

The reason of this is that they did not see that the causes were

numerous, but only saw the material and efficient and did not

distinguish even these, while they made no inquiry at all into the

formal and final causes.

  Everything then exists for a final cause, and all those things which

are included in the definition of each animal, or which either are

means to an end or are ends in themselves, come into being both

through this cause and the rest. But when we come to those things

which come into being without falling under the heads just

mentioned, their course must be sought in the movement or process of

coming into being, on the view that the differences which mark them

arise in the actual formation of the animal. An eye, for instance, the

animal must have of necessity  (for the fundamental idea of the animal

is of such a kind),  but it will have an eye of a particular kind of

necessity in another sense, not the sense mentioned just above,

because it is its nature to act or be acted on in this or that way.

  These distinctions being drawn let us speak of what comes next in

order. As soon then as the offspring of all animals are born,

especially those born imperfect, they are in the habit of sleeping,

because they continue sleeping also within the mother when they

first acquire sensation. But there is a difficulty about the

earliest period of development, whether the state of wakefulness

exists in animals first, or that of sleep. Since they plainly wake

up more as they grow older, it is reasonable to suppose that the

opposite state, that of sleep, exists in the first stages of

development. Moreover the change from not being to being must pass

through the intermediate condition, and sleep seems to be in its

nature such a condition, being as it were a boundary between living

and not living, and the sleeper being neither altogether

non-existent nor yet existent. For life most of all appertains to

wakefulness, on account of sensation. But on the other hand, if it

is necessary that the animal should have sensation and if it is then

first an animal when it has acquired sensation, we ought to consider

the original condition to be not sleep but only something resembling

sleep, such a condition as we find also in plants, for indeed at

this time animals do actually live the life of a plant. But it is

impossible that plants should sleep, for there is no sleep which

cannot be broken, and the condition in plants which is analogous to

sleep cannot be broken.

  It is necessary then for the embryo animal to sleep most of the time

because the growth takes place in the upper part of the body, which is

consequently heavier  (and we have stated elsewhere that such is the

cause of sleep).  But nevertheless they are found to wake even in

the womb  (this is clear in dissections and in the ovipara),  and then

they immediately fall into a sleep again. This is why after birth also

they spend most of their time in sleep.

  When awake infants do not laugh, but while asleep they both laugh

and cry. For animals have sensations even while asleep, not only

what are called dreams but also others besides dreams, as those

persons who arise while sleeping and do many things without

dreaming. For there are some who get up while sleeping and walk

about seeing just like those who are awake; these have perception of

what is happening, and though they are not awake, yet this

perception is not like a dream. So infants presumably have

sense-perception and live in their sleep owing to previous habit,

being as it were without knowledge of the waking state. As time goes

on and their growth is transferred to the lower part of the body, they

now wake up more and spend most of their time in that condition.

Children continue asleep at first more than other animals, for they

are born in a more imperfect condition than other animals that are

produced in anything like a perfect state, and their growth has

taken place more in the upper part of the body.

  The eyes of all children are bluish immediately after birth; later

on they change to the colour which is to be theirs permanently. But in

the case of other animals this is not visible. The reason of this is

that the eyes of other animals are more apt to have only one colour

for each kind of animal; e.g. cattle are dark-eyed, the eye of all

sheep is pale, of others again the whole kind is blue or grey-eyed,

and some are yellow  (goat-eyed),  as the majority of goats

themselves, whereas the eyes of men happen to be of many colours,

for they are blue or grey or dark in some cases and yellow in

others. Hence, as the individuals in other kinds of animals do not

differ from one another in the colour, so neither do they differ

from themselves, for they are not of a nature to have more than one

colour. Of the other animals the horse has the greatest variety of

colour in the eye, for some of them are actually heteroglaucous;

this phenomenon is not to be seen in any of the other animals, but man

is sometimes heteroglaucous.

  Why then is it that there is no visible change in the other

animals if we compare their condition when newly born with their

condition at a more advanced age, but that there is such a change in

children? We must consider just this to be a sufficient cause, that

the part concerned has only one colour in the former but several

colours in the latter. And the reason why the eyes of infants are

bluish and have no other colour is that the parts are weaker in the

newly born and blueness is a sort of weakness.

  We must also gain a general notion about the difference in eyes, for

what reason some are blue, some grey, some yellow, and some dark. To

suppose that the blue are fiery, as Empedocles says, while the dark

have more water than fire in them, and that this is why the former,

the blue, have not keen sight by day, viz. owing to deficiency of

water in their composition, and the latter are in like condition by

night, viz. owing to deficiency of fire- this is not well said if

indeed we are to assume sight to be connected with water, not fire, in

all cases. Moreover it is possible to render another account of the

cause of the colours, but if indeed the fact is as was stated before

in the treatise on the senses, and still earlier than that in the

investigations concerning soul- if this sense organ is composed of

water and if we were right in saying for what reason it is composed of

water and not of air or fire- then we must assume the water to be

the cause of the colours mentioned. For some eyes have too much liquid

to be adapted to the movement, others have too little, others the

due amount. Those eyes therefore in which there is much liquid are

dark because much liquid is not transparent, those which have little

are blue;  (so we find in the sea that the transparent part of it

appears light blue, the less transparent watery, and the

unfathomable water is dark or deep-blue on account of its depth).

When we come to the eyes between these, they differ only in degree.

  We must suppose the same cause also to be responsible for the fact

that blue eyes are not keen-sighted by day nor dark eyes by night.

Blue eyes, because there is little liquid in them, are too much

moved by the light and by visible objects in respect of their

liquidity as well as their transparency, but sight is the movement

of this part in so far as it is transparent, not in so far as it is

liquid. Dark eyes are less moved because of the quantity of liquid

in them. And so they see less well in the dusk, for the nocturnal

light is weak; at the same time also liquid is in general hard to move

in the night. But if the eye is to see, it must neither not be moved

at all nor yet more than in so far as it is transparent, for the

stronger movement drives out the weaker. Hence it is that on

changing from strong colours, or on going out of the sun into the

dark, men cannot see, for the motion already existing in the eye,

being strong, stops that from outside, and in general neither a strong

nor a weak sight can see bright things because the liquid is acted

upon and moved too much.

  The same thing is shown also by the morbid affections of each kind

of sight. Cataract attacks the blue-eyed more, but what is called

'nyctalopia' the dark-eyed. Now cataract is a sort of dryness of the

eyes and therefore it is found more in the aged, for this part also

like the rest of the body gets dry towards old age; but is an excess

of liquidity and so is found more in the younger, for their brain is

more liquid.

  The sight of the eye which is intermediate between too much and

too little liquid is the best, for it has neither too little so as

to be disturbed and hinder the movement of the colours, nor too much

so as to cause difficulty of movement.

  Not only the above-mentioned facts are causes of seeing keenly or

the reverse, but also the nature of the skin upon what is called the

pupil. This ought to be transparent, and it is necessary that the

transparent should be thin and white and even, thin that the

movement coming from without may pass straight through it, even that

it may not cast a shade the liquid behind it by wrinkling  (for this

also is a reason why old men have not keen sight, the skin of the

eye like the rest of the skin wrinkling and becoming thicker in old

age),  and white because black is not transparent, for that is just

what is meant by 'black', what is not shone through, and that is why

lanterns cannot give light if they be made of black skin. It is for

these reasons then that the sight is not keen in old age nor in the

diseases in question, but it is because of the small amount of

liquid that the eyes of children appear blue at first.

  And the reason why men especially and horses occasionally are

heteroglaucous is the same as the reason why man alone grows grey

and the horse is the only other animal whose hairs whiten visibly in

old age. For greyness is a weakness of the fluid in the brain and an

incapacity to concoct properly, and so is blueness of the eyes; excess

of thinness or of thickness produces the same effect, according as

this liquidity is too little or too much. Whenever then Nature

cannot make the eyes correspond exactly, either by concocting or by

not concocting the liquid in both, but concocts the one and not the

other, then the result is heteroglaucia.

  The cause of some animals being keen-sighted and others not so is

not simple but double. For the word 'keen' has pretty much a double

sense  (and this is the case in like manner with hearing and

smelling).  In one sense keen sight means the power of seeing at a

distance, in another it means the power of distinguishing as

accurately as possible the objects seen. These two faculties are not

necessarily combined in the same individual. For the same person, if

he shades his eyes with his hand or look through a tube, does not

distinguish the differences of colour either more or less in any

way, but he will see further; in fact, men in pits or wells

sometimes see the stars. Therefore if any animal's brows project far

over the eye, but if the liquid in the pupil is not pure nor suited to

the movement coming from external objects and if the skin over the

surface is not thin, this animal will not distinguish accurately the

differences of the colours but it will be able to see from a long

distance  (just as it can from a short one)  better than those in

which the liquid and the covering membrane are pure but which have

no brows projecting over the eyes. For the cause of seeing keenly in

the sense of distinguishing the differences is in the eye itself; as

on a clean garment even small stains are visible, so also in a pure

sight even small movements are plain and cause sensation. But it is

the position of the eyes that is the cause of seeing things far off

and of the movements in the transparent medium coming to the eyes from

distant objects. A proof of this is that animals with prominent eyes

do not see well at a distance, whereas those which have their eyes

lying deep in the head can see things at a distance because the

movement is not dispersed in space but comes straight to the eye.

For it makes no difference whether we say, as some do, that seeing

is caused by the sight going forth from the eye- on that view, if

there is nothing projecting over the eyes, the sight must be scattered

and so less of it will fall on the objects of vision and things at a

distance will not be seen so well- or whether we say that seeing is

due to the movement coming from the objects; for the sight also must

see, in a manner resembling the movement. Things at a distance,

then, would be seen best if there were, so to say, a continuous tube

straight from the sight to its object, for the movement from the

object would not then be dissipated; but, if that is impossible, still

the further the tube extends the more accurately must distant

objects be seen.

  Let these, then, be given as the causes of the difference in eyes.

                                 2



  It is the same also with hearing and smell; to hear and smell

accurately mean in one sense to perceive as precisely as possible

all the distinctions of the objects of perception, in another sense to

hear and smell far off. As with sight, so here the sense-organ is

the cause of judging well the distinctions, if both that organ

itself and the membrane round it be pure. For the passages of all

the sense-organs, as has been said in the treatise on sensation, run

to the heart, or to its analogue in creatures that have no heart.

The passage of the hearing, then, since this sense-organ is of air,

ends at the place where the innate spiritus causes in some animals the

pulsation of the heart and in others respiration; wherefore also it is

that we are able to understand what is said and repeat what we have

heard, for as was the movement which entered through the

sense-organ, such again is the movement which is caused by means of

the voice, being as it were of one and the same stamp, so that a man

can say what he has heard. And we hear less well during a yawn or

expiration than during inspiration, because the starting-point of

the sense-organ of hearing is set upon the part concerned with

breathing and is shaken and moved as the organ moves the breath, for

while setting the breath in motion it is moved itself. The same

thing happens in wet weather or a damp atmosphere.... And the ears

seemed to be filled with air because their starting-point is near

the region of breathing.

  Accuracy then in judging the differences of sounds and smells

depends on the purity of the sense-organ and of the membrane lying

upon its surface, for then all the movements become clear in such

cases, as in the case of sight. Perception and non-perception at a

distance also depend on the same things with hearing and smell as with

sight. For those animals can perceive at a distance which have

channels, so to say, running through the parts concerned and

projecting far in front of the sense-organs. Therefore all animals

whose nostrils are long, as the Laconian hounds, are keen-scented, for

the sense-organ being above them, the movements from a distance are

not dissipated but go straight to the mark, just as the movements

which cause sight do with those who shadow the eyes with the hand.

  Similar is the case of animals whose ears are long and project far

like the eaves of a house, as in some quadrupeds, with the internal

spiral passage long; these also catch the movement from afar and

pass it on to the sense-organ.

  In respect of sense-perception at a distance, man is, one may say,

the worst of all animals in proportion to his size, but in respect

of judging the differences of quality in the objects he is the best of

all. The reason is that the sense-organ in man is pure and least

earthy and material, and he is by nature the thinnest-skinned of all

animals for his size.

  The workmanship of Nature is admirable also in the seal, for

though a viviparous quadruped it has no ears but only passages for

hearing. This is because its life is passed in the water; now the

ear is a part added to the passages to preserve the movement of the

air at a distance; therefore an ear is no use to it but would even

bring about the contrary result by receiving a mass of water into

itself.

  We have thus spoken of sight, hearing, and smell.

                                 3



  As for hair, men differ in this themselves at different ages, and

also from all other kinds of animals that have hair. These are

almost all which are internally viviparous, for even when the covering

of such animals is spiny it must be considered as a kind of hair, as

in the land hedgehog and any other such animal among the vivipara.

Hairs differ in respect of hardness and softness, length and

shortness, straightness and curliness, quantity and scantiness, and in

addition to these qualities, in their colours, whiteness and blackness

and the intermediate shades. They differ also in some of these

respects according to age, as they are young or growing old. This is

especially plain in man; the hair gets coarser as time goes on, and

some go bald on the front of the head; children indeed do not go bald,

nor do women, but men do so by the time their age is advancing.

Human beings also go grey on the head as they grow old, but this is

not visible in practically any other animal, though more so in the

horse than others. Men go bald on the front of the head, but turn grey

first on the temples; no one goes bald first on these or on the back

of the head. Some such affections occur in a corresponding manner also

in all animals which have not hair but something analogous to it, as

the feathers of birds and scales in the class of fish.

  For what purpose Nature has made hair in general for animals has

been previously stated in the work dealing with the causes of the

parts of animals; it is the business of the present inquiry to show

under what circumstances and for what necessary causes each particular

kind of hair occurs. The principal cause then of thickness and

thinness is the skin, for this is thick in some animals and thin in

others, rare in some and dense in others. The different quality of the

included moisture is also a helping cause, for in some animals this is

greasy and in others watery. For generally speaking the substratum

of the skin is of an earthy nature; being on the surface of the body

it becomes solid and earthy as the moisture evaporates. Now the

hairs or their analogue are not formed out of the flesh but out of the

skin moisture evaporating and exhaling in them, and therefore thick

hairs arise from a thick skin and thin from thin. If then the skin

is rarer and thicker, the hairs are thick because of the quantity of

earthy matter and the size of the pores, but if it is denser they

are thin because of the narrowness of the pores. Further, if the

moisture be watery it dries up quickly and the hairs do not gain in

size, but if it be greasy the opposite happens, for the greasy is

not easily dried up. Therefore the thicker-skinned animals are as a

general rule thicker-haired for the causes mentioned; however, the

thickest-skinned are not more so than other thick-skinned ones, as

is shown by the class of swine compared to that of oxen and to the

elephant and many others. And for the same reason also the hairs of

the head in man are thickest, for this part of his skin is thickest

and lies over most moisture and besides is very porous.

  The cause of the hairs being long or short depends on the

evaporating moisture not being easily dried. Of this there are two

causes, quantity and quality; if the liquid is much it does not dry up

easily nor if it is greasy. And for this reason the hairs of the

head are longest in man, for the brain, being fluid and cold, supplies

great abundance of moisture.

  The hairs become straight or curly on account of the vapour

arising in them. If it be smoke-like, it is hot and dry and so makes

the hair curly, for it is twisted as being carried with a double

motion, the earthy part tending downwards and the hot upwards. Thus,

being easily bent, it is twisted owing to its weakness, and this is

what is meant by curliness in hair. It is possible then that this is

the cause, but it is also possible that, owing to its having but

little moisture and much earthy matter in it, it is dried by the

surrounding air and so coiled up together. For what is straight

becomes bent, if the moisture in it is evaporated, and runs together

as a hair does when burning upon the fire; curliness will then be a

contraction owing to deficiency of moisture caused by the heat of

the environment. A sign of this is the fact that curly hair is

harder than straight, for the dry is hard. And animals with much

moisture are straight-haired; for in these hairs the moisture advances

as a stream, not in drops. For this reason the Scythians on the

Black Sea and the Thracians are straight-haired, for both they

themselves and the environing air are moist, whereas the Aethiopians

and men in hot countries are curly-haired, for their brains and the

surrounding air are dry.

  Some, however, of the thick-skinned animals are fine-haired for

the cause previously stated, for the finer the pores are the finer

must the hairs be. Hence the class of sheep have such hairs  (for wool

is only a multitude of hairs).

  There are some animals whose hair is soft and yet less fine, as is

the case with the class of hares compared with that of sheep; in

such animals the hair is on the surface of the skin, not deeply rooted

in it, and so is not long but in much the same state as the

scrapings from linen, for these also are not long but are soft and

do not admit of weaving.

  The condition of sheep in cold climates is opposite to that of

man; the hair of the Scythians is soft but that of the Sauromatic

sheep is hard. The reason of this is the same as it is also all wild

animals. The cold hardens and solidifies them by drying them, for as

the heat is pressed out the moisture evaporates, and both hair and

skin become earthy and hard. In wild animals then the exposure to

the cold is the cause of hardness in the hair, in the others the

nature of the climate is the cause. A proof of this is also what

happens in the sea-urchins which are used as a remedy in

stranguries. For these, too, though small themselves, have large and

hard spines because the sea in which they live is cold on account of

its depth  (for they are found in sixty fathoms and even more).  The

spines are large because the growth of the body is diverted to them,

since having little heat in them they do not concoct their nutriment

and so have much residual matter and it is from this that spines,

hairs, and such things are formed; they are hard and petrified through

the congealing effect of the cold. In the same way also plants are

found to be harder, more earthy, and stony, if the region in which

they grow looks to the north than if it looks to the south, and

those in windy places than those in sheltered, for they are all more

chilled and their moisture evaporates.

  Hardening, then, comes of both heat and cold, for both cause the

moisture to evaporate, heat per se and cold per accidens  (since the

moisture goes out of things along with the heat, there being no

moisture without heat),  but whereas cold not only hardens but also

condenses, heat makes a substance rarer.

  For the same reason, as animals grow older, the hairs become

harder in those which have hairs, and the feathers and scales in the

feathered and scaly kinds. For their skins become harder and thicker

as they get older, for they are dried up, and old age, as the word

denotes, is earthy because the heat fails and the moisture along

with it.

  Men go bald visibly more than any other animal, but still such a

state is something general, for among plants also some are

evergreens while others are deciduous, and birds which hibernate

shed their feathers. Similar to this is the condition of baldness in

those human beings to whom it is incident. For leaves are shed by

all plants, from one part of the plant at a time, and so are

feathers and hairs by those animals that have them; it is when they

are all shed together that the condition is described by the terms

mentioned, for it is called 'going bald' and 'the fall of the leaf'

and 'moulting'. The cause of the condition is deficiency of hot

moisture, such moisture being especially the unctuous, and hence

unctuous plants are more evergreen.  (However we must elsewhere

state the cause of this phenomena in plants, for other causes also

contribute to it.)  It is in winter that this happens to plants

(for the change from summer to winter is more important to them than

the time of life),  and to those animals which hibernate  (for

these, too, are by nature less hot and moist than man);  in the latter

it is the seasons of life that correspond to summer and winter.

Hence no one goes bald before the time of sexual intercourse, and at

that time it is in those naturally inclined to such intercourse that

baldness appears, for the brain is naturally the coldest part of the

body and sexual intercourse makes men cold, being a loss of pure

natural heat. Thus we should expect the brain to feel the effect of it

first, for a little cause turns the scale where the thing concerned is

weak and in poor condition. Thus if we reckon up these points, that

the brain itself has but little heat, and further that the skin

round it must needs have still less, and again that the hair must have

still less than the skin inasmuch as it is furthest removed from the

brain, we should reasonably expect baldness to come about this age

upon those who have much semen. And it is for the same reason that the

front part of the head alone goes bald in man and that he is the

only animal to do so; the front part goes bald because the brain is

there, and man is the only animal to go bald because his brain is much

the largest and the moistest. Women do not go bald because their

nature is like that of children, both alike being incapable of

producing seminal secretion. Eunuchs do not become bald, because

they change into the female condition. And as to the hair that comes

later in life, eunuchs either do not grow it at all, or lose it if

they happen to have it, with the exception of the pubic hair; for

women also grow that though they have not the other, and this

mutilation is a change from the male to the female condition.

  The reason why the hair does not grow again in cases of baldness,

although both hibernating animals recover their feathers or hair and

trees that have shed their leaves grow leaves again, is this. The

seasons of the year are the turning-points of their lives, rather than

their age, so that when these seasons change they change with them

by growing and losing feathers, hairs, or leaves respectively. But the

winter and summer, spring and autumn of man are defined by his age, so

that, since his ages do not return, neither do the conditions caused

by them return, although the cause of the change of condition is

similar in man to what it is in the animals and plants in question.

  We have now spoken pretty much of all the other conditions of hair.

                                 4



  But as to their colour, it is the nature of the skin that is the

cause of this in other animals and also of their being uni-coloured or

vari-coloured); but in man it is not the cause, except of the hair

going grey through disease  (not through old age),  for in what is

called leprosy the hairs become white; on the contrary, if the hairs

are white the whiteness does not invade the skin. The reason is that

the hairs grow out of skin; if, then, the skin is diseased and white

the hair becomes diseased with it, and the disease of hair is

greyness. But the greyness of hair which is due to age results from

weakness and deficiency of heat. For as the body declines in vigour we

tend to cold at every time of life, and especially in old age, this

age being cold and dry. We must remember that the nutriment coming

to each part of the body is concocted by the heat appropriate to the

part; if the heat is inadequate the part loses its efficiency, and

destruction or disease results.  (We shall speak more in detail of

causes in the treatise on growth and nutrition.)  Whenever, then,

the hair in man has naturally little heat and too much moisture enters

it, its own proper heat is unable to concoct the moisture and so it is

decayed by the heat in the environing air. All decay is caused by

heat, not the innate heat but external heat, as has been stated

elsewhere. And as there is a decay of water, of earth, and all such

material bodies, so there is also of the earthy vapour, for instance

what is called mould  (for mould is a decay of earthy vapour).  Thus

also the liquid nutriment in the hair decays because it is not

concocted, and what is called greyness results. It is white because

mould also, practically alone among decayed things, is white. The

reason of this is that it has much air in it, all earthy vapour

being equivalent to thick air. For mould is, as it were, the

antithesis of hoar-frost; if the ascending vapour be frozen it becomes

hoar-frost, if it be decayed, mould. Hence both are on the surface

of things, for vapour is superficial. And so the comic poets make a

good metaphor in jest when they call grey hairs 'mould of old age' and

For the one is generically the same as greyness, the other

specifically; hoar-frost generically  (for both are a vapour),

mould specifically  (for both are a form of decay).  A proof that this

is so is this: grey hairs have often grown on men in consequence of

disease, and later on dark hairs instead of them after restoration

to health. The reason is that in sickness the whole body is

deficient in natural heat and so the parts besides, even the very

small ones, participate in this weakness; and again, much residual

matter is formed in the body and all its parts in illness, wherefore

the incapacity in the flesh to concoct the nutriment causes the grey

hairs. But when men have recovered health and strength again they

change, becoming as it were young again instead of old; in consequence

the states change also. Indeed, we may rightly call disease an

acquired old age, old age a natural disease; at any rate, some

diseases produce the same effects as old age.

  Men go grey on the temples first, because the back of the head is

empty of moisture owing to its containing no brain, and the 'bregma'

has a great deal of moisture, a large quantity not being liable to

decay; the hair on the temples however has neither so little that it

can concoct it nor so much that it cannot decay, for this region of

the head being between the two extremes is exempt from both states.

The cause of greyness in man has now been stated.

                                 5



  The reason why this change does not take place visibly on account of

age in other animals is the same as that already given in the case

of baldness; their brain is small and less fluid than in man, so

that the heat required for concoction does not altogether fail.

Among them it is most clear in horses of all animals that we know,

because the bone about the brain is thinner in them than in others

in proportion to their size. A sign of this is that a blow to this

spot is fatal to them, wherefore Homer also has said: 'where the first

hairs grow on the skull of horses, and a wound is most fatal.' As then

the moisture easily flows to these hairs because of the thinness of

the bone, whilst the heat fails on account of age, they go grey. The

reddish hairs go grey sooner than the black, redness also being a sort

of weakness of hair and all weak things ageing sooner. It is said,

however, that cranes become darker as they grow old. The reason of

this would be, if it should prove true, that their feathers are

naturally moister than others and as they grow old the moisture in the

feathers is too much to decay easily.

  Greyness comes about by some sort of decay, and is not, as some

think, a withering. (1) A proof of the former statement is the fact

that hair protected by hats or other coverings goes grey sooner

(for the winds prevent decay and the protection keeps off the winds),

and the fact that it is aided by anointing with a mixture of oil and

water. For, though water cools things, the oil mingled with it

prevents the hair from drying quickly, water being easily dried up.

(2) That the process is not a withering, that the hair does not whiten

as grass does by withering, is shown by the fact that some hairs

grow grey from the first, whereas nothing springs up in a withered

state. Many hairs also whiten at the tip, for there is least heat in

the extremities and thinnest parts.

  When the hairs of other animals are white, this is caused by nature,

not by any affection. The cause of the colours in other animals is the

skin; if they are white, the skin is white, if they are dark it is

dark, if they are piebald in consequence of a mixture of the hairs, it

is found to be white in the one part and dark in the other. But in man

the skin is in no way the cause, for even white-skinned men have

very dark hair. The reason is that man has the thinnest skin of all

animals in proportion to his size and therefore it has not strength to

change the hairs; on the contrary the skin itself changes its colour

through its weakness and is darkened by sun and wind, while the

hairs do not change along with it at all. But in the other animals the

skin, owing to its thickness, has the influence belonging to the

soil in which a thing grows, therefore the hairs change according to

the skin but the skin does not change at all in consequence of the

winds and the sun.

                                 6



  Of animals some are uni-coloured  (I mean by this term those of

which the kind as a whole has one colour, as all lions are tawny;

and this condition exists also in birds, fish, and the other classes

of animals alike);  others though many-coloured are yet whole-coloured

 (I mean those whose body as a whole has the same colour, as a bull is

white as a whole or dark as a whole);  others are vari-coloured.

This last term is used in both ways; sometimes the whole kind is

vari-coloured, as leopards and peacocks, and some fish, e.g. the

so-called 'thrattai'; sometimes the kind as a whole is not so, but

such individuals are found in it, as with cattle and goats and,

among birds, pigeons; the same applies also to other kinds of birds.

The whole-coloured change much more than the uniformly coloured,

both into the simple colour of another individual of the same kind

(as dark changing into white and vice versa)  and into both colours

mingled. This is because it is a natural characteristic of the kind as

a whole not to have one colour only, the kind being easily moved in

both directions so that the colours both change more into one

another and are more varied. The opposite holds with the uniformly

coloured; they do not change except by an affection of the colour, and

that rarely; but still they do so change, for before now white

individuals have been observed among partridges, ravens, sparrows, and

bears. This happens when the course of development is perverted, for

what is small is easily spoilt and easily moved, and what is

developing is small, the beginning of all such things being on a small

scale.

  Change is especially found in those animals of which by nature the

individual is whole-coloured but the kind many-coloured. This is owing

to the water which they drink, for hot waters make the hair white,

cold makes it dark, an effect found also in plants. The reason is that

the hot have more air than water in them, and the air shining

through causes whiteness, as also in froth. As, then, skins which

are white by reason of some affection differ from those white by

nature, so also in the hair the whiteness due to disease or age

differs from that due to nature in that the cause is different; the

latter are whitened by the natural heat, the former by the external

heat. Whiteness is caused in all things by the vaporous air imprisoned

in them. Hence also in all animals not uniformly coloured all the part

under the belly is whiter. For practically all white animals are

both hotter and better flavoured for the same reason; the concoction

of their nutriment makes them well-flavoured, and heat causes the

concoction. The same cause holds for those animals which are

uniformly-coloured, but either dark or white; heat and cold are the

causes of the nature of the skin and hair, each of the parts having

its own special heat.

  The tongue also varies in colour in the simply coloured as

compared with the vari-coloured animals, and again in the simply

coloured which differ from one another, as white and dark. The

reason is that assigned before, that the skins of the vari-coloured

are vari-coloured, and the skins of the white-haired and dark-haired

are white and dark in each case. Now we must conceive of the tongue as

one of the external parts, not taking into account the fact that it is

covered by the mouth but looking on it as we do on the hand or foot;

thus since the skin of the vari-coloured animals is not uniformly

coloured, this is the cause of the skin on the tongue being also

vari-coloured.

  Some birds and some wild quadrupeds change their colour according to

the seasons of the year. The reason is that, as men change according

to their age, so the same thing happens to them according to the

season; for this makes a greater difference to them than the change of

age.

  The more omnivorous animals are more vari-coloured to speak

generally, and this is what might be expected; thus bees are more

uniformly coloured than hornets and wasps. For if the food is

responsible for the change we should expect varied food to increase

the variety in the movements which cause the development and so in the

residual matter of the food, from which come into being hairs and

feathers and skins.

  So much for colours and hairs.

                                 7



  As to the voice, it is deep in some animals, high in others, in

others again well-pitched and in due proportion between both extremes.

Again, in some it is loud, in others small, and it differs in

smoothness and roughness, flexibility and inflexibility. We must

inquire then into the causes of each of these distinctions.

  We must suppose then that the same cause is responsible for high and

deep voices as for the change which they undergo in passing from youth

to age. The voice is higher in all other animals when younger, but

in cattle that of calves is deeper. We find the same thing also in the

male and female sexes; in the other kinds of animals the voice of

the female is higher than that of the male  (this being especially

plain in man, for Nature has given this faculty to him in the

highest degree because he alone of animals makes use of speech and the

voice is the material of speech),  but in cattle the opposite obtains,

for the voice of cows is deeper than that of bulls.

  Now the purpose for which animals have a voice, and what is meant by

'voice' and by 'sound' generally, has been stated partly in the

treatise on sensation, partly in that on the soul. But since lowness

of voice depends on the movement of the air being slow and its

highness on its being quick, there is a difficulty in knowing

whether it is that which moves or that which is moved that is the

cause of the slowness or quickness. For some say that what is much

is moved slowly, what is little quickly, and that the quantity of

the air is the cause of some animals having a deep and others a high

voice. Up to a certain point this is well said  (for it seems to be

rightly said in a general way that the depth depends on a certain

amount of the air put in motion),  but not altogether, for if this

were true it would not be easy to speak both soft and deep at once,

nor again both loud and high. Again, the depth seems to belong to

the nobler nature, and in songs the deep note is better than the

high-pitched ones, the better lying in superiority, and depth of

tone being a sort of superiority. But then depth and height in the

voice are different from loudness and softness, and some high-voiced

animals are loud-voiced, and in like manner some soft-voiced ones

are deep-voiced, and the same applies to the tones lying between these

extremes. And by what else can we define these  (I mean loudness and

softness of voice)  except by the large and small amount of the air

put in motion? If then height and depth are to be decided in

accordance with the distinction postulated, the result will be that

the same animals will be deep-and loud-voiced, and the same will be

high-and not loud-voiced; but this is false.

  The reason of the difficulty is that the words 'great' and

'small', 'much' and 'little' are used sometimes absolutely,

sometimes relatively to one another. Whether an animal has a great

(or loud)  voice depends on the air which is moved being much

absolutely, whether it has a small voice depends on its being little

absolutely; but whether they have a deep or high voice depends on

their being thus differentiated in relation to one another. For if

that which is moved surpass the strength of that which moves it, the

air that is sent forth must go slowly; if the opposite, quickly. The

strong, then, on account of their strength, sometimes move much air

and make the movement slow, sometimes, having complete command over

it, make the movement swift. On the same principle the weak either

move too much air for their strength and so make the movement slow, or

if they make it swift move but little because of their weakness.

  These, then, are the reasons of these contrarieties, that neither

are all young animals high-voiced nor all deep-voiced, nor are all the

older, nor yet are the two sexes thus opposed, and again that not only

the sick speak in a high voice but also those in good bodily

condition, and, further, that as men verge on old age they become

higher-voiced, though this age is opposite to that of youth.

  Most young animals, then, and most females set but little air in

motion because of their want of power, and are consequently

high-voiced, for a little air is carried along quickly, and in the

voice what is quick is high. But in calves and cows, in the one case

because of their age, in the other because of their female nature, the

part by which they set the air in motion is not strong; at the same

time they set a great quantity in motion and so are deep-voiced; for

that which is borne along slowly is heavy, and much air is borne along

slowly. And these animals set much in movement whereas the others

set but little, because the vessel through which the breath is first

borne has in them a large opening and necessarily sets much air in

motion, whereas in the rest the air is better dispensed. As their

age advances this part which moves the air gains more strength in each

animal, so that they change into the opposite condition, the

high-voiced becoming deeper-voiced than they were, and the deep-voiced

higher-voiced, which is why bulls have a higher voice than calves

and cows. Now the strength of all animals is in their sinews, and so

those in the prime of life are stronger, the young being weaker in the

joints and sinews; moreover, in the young they are not yet tense,

and in those now growing old the tension relaxes, wherefore both these

ages are weak and powerless for movement. And bulls are particularly

sinewy, even their hearts, and therefore that part by which they set

the air in motion is in a tense state, like a sinewy string

stretched tight.  (That the heart of bulls is of such a nature is

shown by the fact that a bone is actually found in some of them, and

bones are naturally connected with sinew.)

  All animals when castrated change to the female character, and utter

a voice like that of the females because the sinewy strength in the

principle of the voice is relaxed. This relaxation is just as if one

should stretch a string and make it taut by hanging some weight on

to it, as women do who weave at the loom, for they stretch the warp by

attaching to it what are called 'laiai'. For in this way are the

testes attached to the seminal passages, and these again to the

blood-vessel which takes its origin in the heart near the organ

which sets the voice in motion. Hence as the seminal passages change

towards the age at which they are now able to secrete the semen,

this part also changes along with them. As this changes, the voice

again changes, more indeed in males, but the same thing happens in

females too, only not so plainly, the result being what some call

'bleating' when the voice is uneven. After this it settles into the

deep or high voice of the succeeding time of life. If the testes are

removed the tension of the passages relaxes, as when the weight is

taken off the string or the warp; as this relaxes, the organ which

moves the voice is loosened in the same proportion. This, then, is the

reason why the voice and the form generally changes to the female

character in castrated animals; it is because the principle is relaxed

upon which depends the tension of the body; not that, as some suppose,

the testes are themselves a ganglion of many principles, but small

changes are the causes of great ones, not per se but when it happens

that a principle changes with them. For the principles, though small

in size, are great in potency; this, indeed, is what is meant by a

principle, that it is itself the cause of many things without anything

else being higher than it for it to depend upon.

  The heat or cold also of their habitat contributes to make some

animals of such a character as to be deep-voiced, and others

high-voiced. For hot breath being thick causes depth, cold breath

being thin the opposite. This is clear also in pipe-playing, for if

the breath of the performer is hotter, that is to say if it is

expelled as by a groan, the note is deeper.

  The cause of roughness and smoothness in the voice, and of all

similar inequality, is that the part or organ through which the

voice is conveyed is rough or smooth or generally even or uneven. This

is plain when there is any moisture about the trachea or when it is

roughened by any affection, for then the voice also becomes uneven.

  Flexibility depends on the softness or hardness of the organ, for

what is soft can be regulated and assume any form, while what is

hard cannot; thus the soft organ can utter a loud or a small note, and

accordingly a high or a deep one, since it easily regulates the

breath, becoming itself easily great or small. But hardness cannot

be regulated.

  Let this be enough on all those points concerning the voice which

have not been previously discussed in the treatise on sensation and in

that on the soul.

                                 8



  With regard to the teeth it has been stated previously that they

do not exist for a single purpose nor for the same purpose in all

animals, but in some for nutrition only, in others also for fighting

and for vocal speech. We must, however, consider it not alien to the

discussion of generation and development to inquire into the reason

why the front teeth are formed first and the grinders later, and why

the latter are not shed but the former are shed and grow again.

  Democritus has spoken of these questions but not well, for he

assigns the cause too generally without investigating the facts in all

cases. He says that the early teeth are shed because they are formed

in animals too early, for it is when animals are practically in

their prime that they grow according to Nature, and suckling is the

cause he assigns for their being found too early. Yet the pig also

suckles but does not shed its teeth, and, further, all the animals

with carnivorous dentition suckle, but some of them do not shed any

teeth except the canines, e.g. lions. This mistake, then, was due to

his speaking generally without examining what happens in all cases;

but this is what we to do, for any one who makes any general statement

must speak of all the particular cases.

  Now we assume, basing our assumption upon what we see, that Nature

never fails nor does anything in vain so far as is possible in each

case. And it is necessary, if an animal is to obtain food after the

time of taking milk is over, that it should have instruments for the

treatment of the food. If, then, as Democritus says, this happened

about the time of reaching maturity, Nature would fail in something

possible for her to do. And, besides, the operation of Nature would be

contrary to Nature, for what is done by violence is contrary to

Nature, and it is by violence that he says the formation of the

first teeth is brought about. That this view then is not true is plain

from these and other similar considerations.

  Now these teeth are developed before the flat teeth, in the first

place because their function is earlier  (for dividing comes before

crushing, and the flat teeth are for crushing, the others for

dividing),  in the second place because the smaller is naturally

developed quicker than the larger, even if both start together, and

these teeth are smaller in size than the grinders, because the bone of

the jaw is flat in that part but narrow towards the mouth. From the

greater part, therefore, must flow more nutriment to form the teeth,

and from the narrower part less.

  The act of sucking in itself contributes nothing to the formation of

the teeth, but the heat of the milk makes them appear more quickly.

A proof of this is that even in suckling animals those young which

enjoy hotter milk grow their teeth quicker, heat being conducive to

growth.

  They are shed, after they have been formed, partly because it is

better so  (for what is sharp is soon blunted, so that a fresh relay

is needed for the work, whereas the flat teeth cannot be blunted but

are only smoothed in time by wearing down),  partly from necessity

because, while the roots of the grinders are fixed where the jaw is

flat and the bone strong, those of the front teeth are in a thin part,

so that they are weak and easily moved. They grow again because they

are shed while the bone is still growing and the animal is still young

enough to grow teeth. A proof of this is that even the flat teeth grow

for a long time, the last of them cutting the gum at about twenty

years of age; indeed in some cases the last teeth have been grown in

quite old age. This is because there is much nutriment in the broad

part of the bones, whereas the front part being thin soon reaches

perfection and no residual matter is found in it, the nutriment

being consumed in its own growth.

  Democritus, however, neglecting the final cause, reduces to

necessity all the operations of Nature. Now they are necessary, it

is true, but yet they are for a final cause and for the sake of what

is best in each case. Thus nothing prevents the teeth from being

formed and being shed in this way; but it is not on account of these

causes but on account of the end  (or final cause);  these are

causes only in the sense of being the moving and efficient instruments

and the material. So it is reasonable that Nature should perform

most of her operations using breath as an instrument, for as some

instruments serve many uses in the arts, e.g. the hammer and anvil

in the smith's art, so does breath in the living things formed by

Nature. But to say that necessity is the only cause is much as if we

should think that the water has been drawn off from a dropsical

patient on account of the lancet, not on account of health, for the

sake of which the lancet made the incision.

  We have thus spoken of the teeth, saying why some are shed and

grow again, and others not, and generally for what cause they are

formed. And we have spoken of the other affections of the parts

which are found to occur not for any final end but of necessity and on

account of the motive or efficient cause.
