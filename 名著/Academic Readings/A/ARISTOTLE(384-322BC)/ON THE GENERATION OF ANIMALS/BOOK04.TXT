  WE have thus spoken of the generation of animals both generally

and separately in all the different classes. But, since male and

female are distinct in the most perfect of them, and since we say that

the sexes are first principles of all living things whether animals or

plants, only in some of them the sexes are separated and in others

not, therefore we must speak first of the origin of the sexes in the

latter. For while the animal is still imperfect in its kind the

distinction is already made between male and female.

  It is disputed, however, whether the embryo is male or female, as

the case may be, even before the distinction is plain to our senses,

and further whether it is thus differentiated within the mother or

even earlier. It is said by some, as by Anaxagoras and other of the

physicists, that this antithesis exists from the beginning in the

germs or seeds; for the germ, they say, comes from the male while

the female only provides the place in which it is to be developed, and

the male is from the right, the female from the left testis, and so

also that the male embryo is in the right of the uterus, the female in

the left. Others, as Empedocles, say that the differentiation takes

place in the uterus; for he says that if the uterus is hot or cold

what enters it becomes male or female, the cause of the heat or cold

being the flow of the catamenia, according as it is colder or

hotter, more 'antique' or more 'recent'. Democritus of Abdera also

says that the differentiation of sex takes place within the mother;

that however it is not because of heat and cold that one embryo

becomes female and another male, but that it depends on the question

which parent it is whose semen prevails,- not the whole of the

semen, but that which has come from the part by which male and

female differ from one another. This is a better theory, for certainly

Empedocles has made a rather light-hearted assumption in thinking that

the difference between them is due only to cold and heat, when he

saw that there was a great difference in the whole of the sexual

parts, the difference in fact between the male pudenda and the uterus.

For suppose two animals already moulded in embryo, the one having

all the parts of the female, the other those of the male; suppose them

then to be put into the uterus as into an oven, the former when the

oven is hot, the latter when it is cold; then on the view of

Empedocles that which has no uterus will be female and that which

has will be male. But this is impossible. Thus the theory of

Democritus would be the better of the two, at least as far as this

goes, for he seeks for the origin of this difference and tries to

set it forth; whether he does so well or not is another question.

  Again, if heat and cold were the cause of the difference of the

parts, this ought to have been stated by those who maintain the view

of Empedocles; for to explain the origin of male and female is

practically the same thing as to explain this, which is the manifest

difference between them. And it is no small matter, starting from

temperature as a principle, to collect the cause of the origin of

these parts, as if it were a necessary consequence for this part which

they call the uterus to be formed in the embryo under the influence of

cold but not under that of heat. The same applies also to the parts

which serve for intercourse, since these also differ in the way stated

previously.

  Moreover male and female twins are often found together in the

same part of the uterus; this we have observed sufficiently by

dissection in all the vivipara, both land animals and fish. Now if

Empedocles had not seen this it was only natural for him to fall

into error in assigning this cause of his; but if he had seen it it is

strange that he should still think the heat or cold of the uterus to

be the cause, since on his theory both these twins would have become

either male or female, but as it is we do not see this to be the fact.

  Again he says that the parts of the embryo are 'sundered', some

being in the male and some in the female parent, which is why they

desire intercourse with one another. If so it is necessary that the

sexual parts like the rest should be separated from one another,

already existing as masses of a certain size, and that they should

come into being in the embryo on account of uniting with one

another, not on account of cooling or heating of the semen. But

perhaps it would take too long to discuss thoroughly such a cause as

this which is stated by Empedocles, for its whole character seems to

be fanciful. If, however, the facts about semen are such as we have

actually stated, if it does not come from the whole of the body of the

male parent and if the secretion of the male does not give any

material at all to the embryo, then we must make a stand against

both Empedocles and Democritus and any one else who argues on the same

lines. For then it is not possible that the body of the embryo

should exist 'sundered', part in the female parent and part in the

male, as Empedocles says in the words: 'But the nature of the limbs

hath been sundered, part in the man's...'; nor yet that a whole embryo

is drawn off from each parent and the combination of the two becomes

male or female according as one part prevails over another.

  And, to take a more general view, though it is better to say that

the one part makes the embryo female by prevailing through some

superiority than to assign nothing but heat as the cause without any

reflection, yet, as the form of the pudendum also varies along with

the uterus from that of the father, we need an explanation of the fact

that both these parts go along with each other. If it is because

they are near each other, then each of the other parts also ought to

go with them, for one of the prevailing parts is always near another

part where the struggle is not yet decided; thus the offspring would

be not only female or male but also like its mother or father

respectively in all other details.

  Besides, it is absurd to suppose that these parts should come into

being as something isolated, without the body as a whole having

changed along with them. Take first and foremost the blood-vessels,

round which the whole mass of the flesh lies as round a framework.

It is not reasonable that these should become of a certain quality

because of the uterus, but rather that the uterus should do so on

account of them. For though it is true that each is a receptacle of

blood of some kind, still the system of the vessels is prior to the

other; the moving principle must needs always be prior to that which

it moves, and it is because it is itself of a certain quality that

it is the cause of the development. The difference, then, of these

parts as compared with each other in the two sexes is only a

concomitant result; not this but something else must be held to be the

first principle and the cause of the development of an embryo as

male or female; this is so even if no semen is secreted by either male

or female, but the embryo is formed in any way you please.

  The same argument as that with which we meet Empedocles and

Democritus will serve against those who say that the male comes from

the right and the female from the left. If the male contributes no

material to the embryo, there can be nothing in this view. If, as they

say, he does contribute something of the sort, we must confront them

in the same way as we did the theory of Empedocles, which accounts for

the difference between male and female by the heat and cold of the

uterus. They make the same mistake as he does, when they account for

the difference by their 'right and left', though they see that the

sexes differ actually by the whole of the sexual parts; for what

reason then is the body of the uterus to exist in those embryos

which come from the left and not in those from the right? For if an

embryo have come from the left but has not acquired this part, it will

be a female without a uterus, and so too there is nothing to stop

another from being a male with a uterus! Besides as has been said

before, a female embryo has been observed in the right part of the

uterus, a male in the left, or again both at once in the same part,

and this not only once but several times.

  Some again, persuaded of the truth of a view resembling that of

these philosophers, say that if a man copulates with the right or left

testis tied up the result is male or female offspring respectively; so

at least Leophanes asserted. And some say that the same happens in the

case of those who have one or other testis excised, not speaking truth

but vaticinating what will happen from probabilities and jumping at

the conclusion that it is so before seeing that it proves to be so.

Moreover, they know not that these parts of animals contribute nothing

to the production of one sex rather than the other; a proof of this is

that many animals in which the distinction of sex exists, and which

produce both male and female offspring, nevertheless have no testes,

as the footless animals; I mean the classes of fish and of serpents.

  To suppose, then, either that heat and cold are the causes of male

and female, or that the different sexes come from the right and

left, is not altogether unreasonable in itself; for the right of the

body is hotter than the left, and the concocted semen is hotter than

the unconcocted; again, the thickened is concocted, and the more

thickened is more fertile. Yet to put it in this way is to seek for

the cause from too remote a starting-point; we must draw near the

immediate causes in so far as it is possible for us.

  We have, then, previously spoken elsewhere of both the body as a

whole and its parts, explaining what each part is and for what

reason it exists. But (1) the male and female are distinguished by a

certain capacity and incapacity.  (For the male is that which can

concoct the blood into semen and which can form and secrete and

discharge a semen carrying with it the principle of form- by

'principle' I do not mean a material principle out of which comes into

being an offspring resembling the parent, but I mean the first

moving cause, whether it have power to act as such in the thing itself

or in something else- but the female is that which receives semen,

indeed, but cannot form it for itself or secrete or discharge it.)

And (2) all concoction works by means of heat. Therefore the males

of animals must needs be hotter than the females. For it is by

reason of cold and incapacity that the female is more abundant in

blood in certain parts of her anatomy, and this abundance is an

evidence of the exact opposite of what some suppose, thinking that the

female is hotter than the male for this reason, i.e. the discharge

of the catamenia. It is true that blood is hot, and that which has

more of it is hotter than that which has less. But they assume that

this discharge occurs through excess of blood and of heat, as if it

could be taken for granted that all blood is equally blood if only

it be liquid and sanguineous in colour, and as if it might not

become less in quantity but purer in quality in those who assimilate

nourishment properly. In fact they look upon this residual discharge

in the same light as that of the intestines, when they think that a

greater amount of it is a sign of a hotter nature, whereas the truth

is just the opposite. For consider the production of fruit; the

nutriment in its first stage is abundant, but the useful product

derived from it is small, indeed the final result is nothing at all

compared to the quantity in the first stage. So is it with the body;

the various parts receive and work up the nutriment, from the whole of

which the final result is quite small. This is blood in some

animals, in some its analogue. Now since (1) the one sex is able and

the other is unable to reduce the residual secretion to a pure form,

and (2) every capacity or power in an organism has a certain

corresponding organ, whether the faculty produces the desired

results in a lower degree or in a higher degree, and the two sexes

correspond in this manner  (the terms 'able' and 'unable' being used

in more senses than one)- therefore it is necessary that both female

and male should have organs. Accordingly the one has the uterus, the

other the male organs.

  Again, Nature gives both the faculty and the organ to each

individual at the same time, for it is better so. Hence each region

comes into being along with the secretions and the faculties, as

e.g. the faculty of sight is not perfected without the eye, nor the

eye without the faculty of sight; and so too the intestine and bladder

come into being along with the faculty of forming the excreta. And

since that from which an organ comes into being and that by which it

is increased are the same  (i.e. the nutriment),  each of the parts

will be made out of such a material and such residual matter as it

is able to receive. In the second place, again, it is formed, as we

say, in a certain sense, out of its opposite. Thirdly, we must

understand besides this that, if it is true that when a thing perishes

it becomes the opposite of what it was, it is necessary also that what

is not under the sway of that which made it must change into its

opposite. After these premisses it will perhaps be now clearer for

what reason one embryo becomes female and another male. For when the

first principle does not bear sway and cannot concoct the

nourishment through lack of heat nor bring it into its proper form,

but is defeated in this respect, then must needs the material which it

works on change into its opposite. Now the female is opposite to the

male, and that in so far as the one is female and the other male.

And since it differs in its faculty, its organ also is different, so

that the embryo changes into this state. And as one part of first-rate

importance changes, the whole system of the animal differs greatly

in form along with it. This may be seen in the case of eunuchs, who,

though mutilated in one part alone, depart so much from their original

appearance and approximate closely to the female form. The reason of

this is that some of the parts are principles, and when a principle is

moved or affected needs must many of the parts that go along with it

change with it.

  If then (1) the male quality or essence is a principle and a

cause, and (2) the male is such in virtue of a certain capacity and

the female is such in virtue of an incapacity, and (3) the essence

or definition of the capacity and of the incapacity is ability or

inability to concoct the nourishment in its ultimate stage, this being

called blood in the sanguinea and the analogue of blood in the other

animals, and (4) the cause of this capacity is in the first

principle and in the part which contains the principle of natural

heat- therefore a heart must be formed in the sanguinea  (and the

resulting animal will be either male or female),  and in the other

kinds which possess the sexes must be formed that which is analogous

to the heart.

  This, then, is the first principle and cause of male and female, and

this is the part of the body in which it resides. But the animal

becomes definitely female or male by the time when it possesses also

the parts by which the female differs from the male, for it is not

in virtue of any part you please that it is male or female, any more

than it is able to see or hear by possessing any part you please.

  To recapitulate, we say that the semen, which is the foundation of

the embryo, is the ultimate secretion of the nutriment. By ultimate

I mean that which is carried to every part of the body, and this is

also the reason why the offspring is like the parent. For it makes

no difference whether we say that the semen comes from all the parts

or goes to all of them, but the latter is the better. But the semen of

the male differs from the corresponding secretion of the female in

that it contains a principle within itself of such a kind as to set up

movements also in the embryo and to concoct thoroughly the ultimate

nourishment, whereas the secretion of the female contains material

alone. If, then, the male element prevails it draws the female element

into itself, but if it is prevailed over it changes into the

opposite or is destroyed. But the female is opposite to the male,

and is female because of its inability to concoct and of the

coldness of the sanguineous nutriment. And Nature assigns to each of

the secretions the part fitted to receive it. But the semen is a

secretion, and this in the hotter animals with blood, i.e. the

males, is moderate in quantity, wherefore the recipient parts of

this secretion in males are only passages. But the females, owing to

inability to concoct, have a great quantity of blood, for it cannot be

worked up into semen. Therefore they must also have a part to

receive this, and this part must be unlike the passages of the male

and of a considerable size. This is why the uterus is of such a

nature, this being the part by which the female differs from the male.

                                  2



  We have thus stated for what reason the one becomes female and the

other male. Observed facts confirm what we have said. For more females

are produced by the young and by those verging on old age than by

those in the prime of life; in the former the vital heat is not yet

perfect, in the latter it is failing. And those of a moister and

more feminine state of body are more wont to beget females, and a

liquid semen causes this more than a thicker; now all these

characteristics come of deficiency in natural heat.

  Again, more males are born if copulation takes place when north than

when south winds are blowing. For in the latter case the animals

produce more secretion, and too much secretion is harder to concoct;

hence the semen of the males is more liquid, and so is the discharge

of the catamenia.

  Also the fact that the catamenia occur in the course of nature

rather when the month is waning is due to the same causes. For this

time of the month is colder and moister because of the waning and

failure of the moon; as the sun makes winter and summer in the year as

a whole, so does the moon in the month. This is not due to the turning

of the moon, but it grows warmer as the light increases and colder

as it wanes.

  The shepherds also say that it not only makes a difference in the

production of males and females if copulation takes place during

northern or southerly winds, but even if the animals while

copulating look towards the south or north; so small a thing will

sometimes turn the scale and cause cold or heat, and these again

influence generation.

  The male and female, then, are distinguished generally, as

compared with one another in connexion with the production of male and

female offspring, for the causes stated. However, they also need a

certain correspondence with one another to produce at all, for all

things that come into being as products of art or of Nature exist in

virtue of a certain ratio. Now if the hot preponderates too much it

dries up the liquid; if it is very deficient it does not solidify

it; for the artistic or natural product we need the due mean between

the extremes. Otherwise it will be as in cooking; too much fire

burns the meat, too little does not cook it, and in either case the

process is a failure. So also there is need of due proportion in the

mixture of the male and female elements. And for this cause it often

happens to many of both sexes that they do not generate with one

another, but if divorced and remarried to others do generate; and

these oppositions show themselves sometimes in youth, sometimes in

advanced age, alike as concerns fertility or infertility, and as

concerns generation of male or female offspring.

  One country also differs from another in these respects, and one

water from another, for the same reasons. For the nourishment and

the medical condition of the body are of such or such a kind because

of the tempering of the surrounding air and of the food entering the

body, especially the water; for men consume more of this than of

anything else, and this enters as nourishment into all food, even

solids. Hence hard waters cause infertility, and cold waters the birth

of females.

                                 3



  The same causes must be held responsible for the following groups of

facts. (1) Some children resemble their parents, while others do

not; some being like the father and others like the mother, both in

the body as a whole and in each part, male and female offspring

resembling father and mother respectively rather than the other way

about. (2) They resemble their parents more than remoter ancestors,

and resemble those ancestors more than any chance individual. (3)

Some, though resembling none of their relations, yet do at any rate

resemble a human being, but others are not even like a human being but

a monstrosity. For even he who does not resemble his parents is

already in a certain sense a monstrosity; for in these cases Nature

has in a way departed from the type. The first departure indeed is

that the offspring should become female instead of male; this,

however, is a natural necessity.  (For the class of animals divided

into sexes must be preserved, and as it is possible for the male

sometimes not to prevail over the female in the mixture of the two

elements, either through youth or age or some other such cause, it

is necessary that animals should produce female young).  And the

monstrosity, though not necessary in regard of a final cause and an

end, yet is necessary accidentally. As for the origin of it, we must

look at it in this way. If the generative secretion in the catamenia

is properly concocted, the movement imparted by the male will make the

form of the embryo in the likeness of itself.  (Whether we say that it

is the semen or this movement that makes each of the parts grow, makes

no difference; nor again whether we say that it 'makes them grow' or

'forms them from the beginning', for the formula of the movement is

the same in either case.)  Thus if this movement prevail, it will make

the embryo male and not female, like the father and not like the

mother; if it prevail not, the embryo is deficient in that faculty

in which it has not prevailed. By 'each faculty' I mean this. That

which generates is not only male but also a particular male, e.g.

Coriscus or Socrates, and it is not only Coriscus but also a man. In

this way some of the characteristics of the father are more near to

him, others more remote from him considered simply as a parent and not

in reference to his accidental qualities  (as for instance if the

parent is a scholar or the neighbour of some particular person).

Now the peculiar and individual has always more force in generation

than the more general and wider characteristics. Coriscus is both a

man and an animal, but his manhood is nearer to his individual

existence than is his animalhood. In generation both the individual

and the class are operative, but the individual is the more so of

the two, for this is the only true existence. And the offspring is

produced indeed of a certain quality, but also as an individual, and

this latter is the true existence. Therefore it is from the forces

of all such existences that the efficient movements come which exist

in the semen; potentially from remoter ancestors but in a higher

degree and more nearly from the individual  (and by the individual I

mean e.g. Coriscus or Socrates).  Now since everything changes not

into anything haphazard but into its opposite, therefore also that

which is not prevailed over in generation must change and become the

opposite, in respect of that particular force in which the paternal

and efficient or moving element has not prevailed. If then it has

not prevailed in so far as it is male, the offspring becomes female;

if in so far as it is Coriscus or Socrates, the offspring does not

resemble the father but the mother. For as 'father' and 'mother' are

opposed as general terms, so also the individual father is opposed

to the individual mother. The like applies also to the forces that

come next in order, for the offspring always changes rather into the

likeness of the nearer ancestor than the more remote, both in the

paternal and in the maternal line.

  Some of the movements exist in the semen actually, others

potentially; actually, those of the father and the general type, as

man and animal; potentially those of the female and the remoter

ancestors. Thus the male and efficient principle, if it lose its own

nature, changes to its opposites, but the movements which form the

embryo change into those nearly connected with them; for instance,

if the movement of the male parent be resolved, it changes by a very

slight difference into that of his father, and in the next instance

into that of his grandfather; and in this way not only in the male but

also in the female line the movement of the female parent changes into

that of her mother, and, if not into this, then into that of her

grandmother; and similarly also with the more remote ancestors.

  Naturally then it is most likely that the characteristics of

'male' and of the individual father will go together, whether they

prevail or are prevailed over. For the difference between them is

small so that there is no difficulty in both concurring, for

Socrates is an individual man with certain characters. Hence for the

most part the male offspring resemble the father, and the female the

mother. For in the latter case the loss of both characters takes place

at once, and the change is into the two opposites; now is opposed to

male, and the individual mother to the individual father.

  But if the movement coming from the male principle prevails while

that coming from the individual Socrates does not, or vice versa, then

the result is that male children are produced resembling the mother

and female children resembling the father.

  If again the movements be resolved, if the male character remain but

the movement coming from the individual Socrates be resolved into that

of the father of Socrates, the result will be a male child

resembling its grandfather or some other of its more remote

ancestors in the male line on the same principle. If the male

principle be prevailed over, the child will be female and resembling

most probably its mother, but, if the movement coming from the

mother also be resolved, it will resemble its mother's mother or the

resemblance will be to some other of its more remote ancestors in

the female line on the same principle.

  The same applies also to the separate parts, for often some of these

take after the father, and others after the mother, and yet others

after some of the remoter ancestors. For, as has been often said

already, some of the movements which form the parts exist in the semen

actually and others potentially. We must grasp certain fundamental

general principles, not only that just mentioned  (that some of the

movements exist potentially and others actually),  but also two

others, that if a character be prevailed over it changes into its

opposite, and, if it be resolved, is resolved into the movement next

allied to it- if less, into that which is near, if more, into that

which is further removed. Finally, the movements are so confused

together that there is no resemblance to any of the family or kindred,

but the only character that remains is that common to the race, i.e.

it is a human being. The reason of this is that this is closely knit

up with the individual characteristics; 'human being' is the general

term, while Socrates, the father, and the mother, whoever she may

be, are individuals.

  The reason why the movements are resolved is this. The agent is

itself acted upon by that on which it acts; thus that which cuts is

blunted by that which is cut by it, that which heats is cooled by that

which is heated by it, and in general the moving or efficient cause

(except in the case of the first cause of all)  does itself receive

some motion in return; e.g. what pushes is itself in a way pushed

again and what crushes is itself crushed again. Sometimes it is

altogether more acted upon than is the thing on which it acts, so that

what is heating or cooling something else is itself cooled or

heated; sometimes having produced no effect, sometimes less than it

has itself received.  (This question has been treated in the special

discussion of action and reaction, where it is laid down in what

classes of things action and reaction exist.)  Now that which is acted

on escapes and is not mastered by the semen, either through deficiency

of power in the concocting and moving agent or because what should

be concocted and formed into distinct parts is too cold and in too

great quantity. Thus the moving agent, mastering it in one part but

not in another, makes the embryo in formation to be multiform, as

happens with athletes because they eat so much. For owing to the

quantity of their food their nature is not able to master it all, so

as to increase and arrange their form symmetrically; therefore their

limbs develop irregularly, sometimes indeed almost so much that no one

of them resembles what it was before. Similar to this is also the

disease known as satyrism, in which the face appears like that of a

satyr owing to a quantity of unconcocted humour or wind being diverted

into parts of the face.

  We have thus discussed the cause of all these phenomena, (1)

female and male offspring are produced, (2) why some are similar to

their parents, female to female and male to male, and others the other

way about, females being similar to the father and males to the

mother, and in general why some are like their ancestors while

others are like none of them, and all this as concerns both the body

as a whole and each of the parts separately. Different accounts,

however, have been given of these phenomena by some of the

nature-philosophers; I mean why children are like or unlike their

parents. They give two versions of the reason. Some say that the child

is more like that parent of the two from whom comes more semen, this

applying equally both to the body as a whole and to the separate

parts, on the assumption that semen comes from each part of both

parents; if an equal part comes from each, then, they say, the child

is like neither. But if this is false, if semen does not come off from

the whole body of the parents, it is clear that the reason assigned

cannot be the cause of likeness and unlikeness. Moreover, they are

hard put to it to explain how it is that a female child can be like

the father and a male like the mother. For (1) those who assign the

same cause of sex as Empedocles or Democritus say what is on other

grounds impossible, and (2) those who say that it is determined by the

greater or smaller amount of semen coming the male or female parent,

and that this is why one child is male and another female, cannot show

how the female is to resemble the father and the male the mother,

for it is impossible that more should come from both at once. Again,

for what reason is a child generally like its ancestors, even the more

remote? None of the semen has come from them at any rate.

  But those who account for the similarity in the manner which remains

to be discussed, explain this point better, as well as the others. For

there are some who say that the semen, though one, is as it were a

common mixture  (panspermia)  of many elements; just as, if one should

mix many juices in one liquid and then take some from it, it would

be possible to take, not an equal quantity always from each juice, but

sometimes more of one and sometimes more of another, sometimes some of

one and none at all of another, so they say it is with the

generative fluid, which is a mixture of many elements, for the

offspring resembles that parent from which it has derived most. Though

this theory is obscure and in many ways fictitious, it aims at what is

better expressed by saying that what is called 'panspermia' exists

potentially, not actually; it cannot exist actually, but it can do

so potentially. Also, if we assign only one sort of cause, it is not

easy to explain all the phenomena, (1) the distinction of sex, (2) why

the female is often like the father and the male like the mother,

and again (3) the resemblance to remoter ancestors, and further (4)

the reason why the offspring is sometimes unlike any of these but

still a human being, but sometimes, (5) proceeding further on these

lines, appears finally to be not even a human being but only some kind

of animal, what is called a monstrosity.

  For, following what has been said, it remains to give the reason for

such monsters. If the movements imparted by the semen are resolved and

the material contributed by the mother is not controlled by them, at

last there remains the most general substratum, that is to say the

animal. Then people say that the child has the head of a ram or a

bull, and so on with other animals, as that a calf has the head of a

child or a sheep that of an ox. All these monsters result from the

causes stated above, but they are none of the things they are said

to be; there is only some similarity, such as may arise even where

there is no defect of growth. Hence often jesters compare some one who

is not beautiful to a 'goat breathing fire', or again to a 'ram

butting', and a certain physiognomist reduced all faces to those of

two or three animals, and his arguments often prevailed on people.

  That, however, it is impossible for such a monstrosity to come

into existence- I mean one animal in another- is shown by the great

difference in the period of gestation between man, sheep, dog, and ox,

it being impossible for each to be developed except in its proper

time.

  This is the description of some of the monsters talked about; others

are such because certain parts of their form are multiplied so that

they are born with many feet or many heads.

  The account of the cause of monstrosities is very close and

similar in a way to that of the cause of animals being born

defective in any part, for monstrosity is also a kind of deficiency.

                                 4



  Democritus said that monstrosities arose because two emissions of

seminal fluid met together, the one succeeding the other at an

interval of time; that the later entering into the uterus reinforced

the earlier so that the parts of the embryo grow together and get

confused with one another. But in birds, he says, since copulation

takes place quickly, both the eggs and their colour always cross one

another. But if it is the fact, as it manifestly is, that several

young are produced from one emission of semen and a single act of

intercourse, it is better not to desert the short road to go a long

way about, for in such cases it is absolutely necessary that this

should occur when the semen is not separated but all enters the female

at once.

  If, then, we must attribute the cause to the semen of the male, this

will be the way we shall have to state it, but we must rather by all

means suppose that the cause lies in the material contributed by the

female and in the embryo as it is forming. Hence also such

monstrosities appear very rarely in animals producing only one young

one, more frequently in those producing many, most of all in birds and

among birds in the common fowl. For this bird produces many young, not

only because it lays often like the pigeon family, but also because it

has many embryos at once and copulates all the year round. Therefore

it produces many double eggs, for the embryos grow together because

they are near one another, as often happens with many fruits. In

such double eggs, when the yolks are separated by the membrane, two

separate chickens are produced with nothing abnormal about them;

when the yolks are continuous, with no division between them, the

chickens produced are monstrous, having one body and head but four

legs and four wings; this is because the upper parts are formed

earlier from the white, their nourishment being drawn from the yolk,

whereas the lower part comes into being later and its nourishment is

one and indivisible.

  A snake has also been observed with two heads for the same reason,

this class also being oviparous and producing many young.

Monstrosities, however, are rarer among them owing to the shape of the

uterus, for by reason of its length the numerous eggs are set in a

line.

  Nothing of the kind occurs with bees and wasps, because their

brood is in separate cells. But in the fowl the opposite is the

case, whereby it is plain that we must hold the cause of such

phenomena to lie in the material. So, too, monstrosities are

commoner in other animals if they produce many young. Hence they are

less common in man, for he produces for the most part only one young

one and that perfect; even in man monstrosities occur more often in

regions where the women give birth to more than one at a time, as in

Egypt. And they are commoner in sheep and goats, since they produce

more young. Still more does this apply to the fissipeds, for such

animals produce many young and imperfect, as the dog, the young of

these creatures being generally blind. Why this happens and why they

produce many young must be stated later, but in them Nature has made

an advance towards the production of monstrosities in that what they

generate, being imperfect, is so far unlike the parent; now

monstrosities also belong to the class of things unlike the parent.

Therefore this accident also often invades animals of such a nature.

So, too, it is in these that the so-called 'metachoera' are most

frequent, and the condition of these also is in a way monstrous, since

both deficiency and excess are monstrous. For the monstrosity

belongs to the class of things contrary to Nature, not any and every

kind of Nature, but Nature in her usual operations; nothing can happen

contrary to Nature considered as eternal and necessary, but we speak

of things being contrary to her in those cases where things

generally happen in a certain way but may also happen in another

way. In fact, even in the case of monstrosities, whenever things occur

contrary indeed to the established order but still always in a certain

way and not at random, the result seems to be less of a monstrosity

because even that which is contrary to Nature is in a certain sense

according to Nature, whenever, that is, the formal nature has not

mastered the material nature. Therefore they do not call such things

monstrosities any more than in the other cases where a phenomenon

occurs habitually, as in fruits; for instance, there is a vine which

some call 'capneos'; if this bear black grapes they do not judge it

a monstrosity because it is in the habit of doing this very often. The

reason is that it is in its nature intermediate between white and

black; thus the change is not a violent one nor, so to say, contrary

to Nature; at least, is it not a change into another nature. But in

animals producing many young not only do the same phenomena occur, but

also the numerous embryos hinder one another from becoming perfect and

interfere with the generative motions imparted by the semen.

  A difficulty may be raised concerning (1) the production of many

young and the multiplication of the parts in a single young one, and

(2) the production of few young or only one and the deficiency of

the parts. Sometimes animals are born with too many toes, sometimes

with one alone, and so on with the other parts, for they may be

multiplied or they may be absent. Again, they may have the

generative parts doubled, the one being male, the other female; this

is known in men and especially in goats. For what are called

'tragaenae' are such because they have both male and female generative

parts; there is a case also of a goat being born with a horn upon

its leg. Changes and deficiencies are found also in the internal

parts, animals either not possessing some at all, or possessing them

in a rudimentary condition, or too numerous or in the wrong place.

No animal, indeed, has ever been born without a heart, but they are

born without a spleen or with two spleens or with one kidney; there is

no case again of total absence of the liver, but there are cases of

its being incomplete. And all these phenomena have been seen in

animals perfect and alive. Animals also which naturally have a

gall-bladder are found without one; others are found to have more than

one. Cases are known, too, of the organs changing places, the liver

being on the left, the spleen on the right. These phenomena have

been observed, as stated above, in animals whose growth is

perfected; at the time of birth great confusion of every kind has been

found. Those deficiency which only depart a little from Nature

commonly live; not so those which depart further, when the unnatural

condition is in the parts which are sovereign over life.

  The question then about all these cases is this. Are we to suppose

that a single cause is responsible for the production of a single

young one and for the deficiency of the parts, and another but still a

single cause for the production of many young and the multiplication

of parts, or not?

  In the first place it seems only reasonable to wonder why some

animals produce many young, others only one. For it is the largest

animals that produce one, e.g. the elephant, camel, horse, and the

other solid-hoofed ungulates; of these some are larger than all

other animals, while the others are of a remarkable size. But the dog,

the wolf, and practically all the fissipeds, produce many, even the

small members of the class, as the mouse family. The cloven-footed

animals again produce few, except the pig, which belongs to those that

produce many. This certainly seems surprising, for we should expect

the large animals to be able to generate more young and to secrete

more semen. But precisely what we wonder at is the reason for not

wondering; it is just because of their size that they do not produce

many young, for the nutriment is expended in such animals upon

increasing the body. But in the smaller animals Nature takes away from

the size and adds the excess so gained to the seminal secretion.

Moreover, more semen must needs be used in generation by the larger

animal, and little by the smaller. Therefore many small ones may be

produced together, but it is hard for many large ones to be so, and to

those intermediate in size Nature has assigned the intermediate

number. We have formerly given the reason why some animals are

large, some smaller, and some between the two, and speaking generally,

with regard to the number of young produced, the solid-hoofed

produce one, the cloven-footed few, the many-toed many.  (The reason

of this is that, generally speaking, their sizes correspond to this

difference.)  It is not so, however, in all cases; for it is the

largeness and smallness of the body that is cause of few or many young

being born, not the fact that the kind of animal has one, two, or many

toes. A proof of this is that the elephant is the largest of animals

and yet is many-toed, and the camel, the next largest, is

cloven-footed. And not only in animals that walk but also in those

that fly or swim the large ones produce few, the small many, for the

same reason. In like manner also it is not the largest plants that

bear most fruit.

  We have explained then why some animals naturally produce many

young, some but few, and some only one; in the difficulty now stated

we may rather be surprised with reason at those which produce many,

since such animals are often seen to conceive from a single

copulation. Whether the semen of the male contributes to the

material of the embryo by itself becoming a part of it and mixing with

the semen of the female, or whether, as we say, it does not act in

this way but brings together and fashions the material within the

female and the generative secretion as the fig-juice does the liquid

substance of milk, what is the reason why it does not form a single

animal of considerable size? For certainly in the parallel case the

fig-juice is not separated if it has to curdle a large quantity of

milk, but the more the milk and the more the fig-juice put into it, so

much the greater is the curdled mass. Now it is no use to say that the

several regions of the uterus attract the semen and therefore more

young than one are formed, because the regions are many and the

cotyledons are more than one. For two embryos are often formed in

the same region of the uterus, and they may be seen lying in a row

in animals that produce many, when the uterus is filled with the

embryos.  (This is plain from the dissections.)  Rather the truth is

this. As animals complete their growth there are certain limits to

their size, both upwards and downwards, beyond which they cannot go,

but it is in the space between these limits that they exceed or fall

short of one another in size, and it is within these limits that one

man  (or any other animal)  is larger or smaller than another. So also

the generative material from which each animal is formed is not

without a quantitative limit in both directions, nor can it be

formed from any quantity you please. Whenever then an animal, for

the cause assigned, discharges more of the female secretion than is

needed for beginning the existence of a single animal, it is not

possible that only one should be formed out of all this, but a

number limited by the appropriate size in each case; nor will the

semen of the male, or the power residing in the semen, form anything

either more or less than what is according to Nature. In like

manner, if the male emits more semen than is necessary, or more powers

in different parts of the semen as it is divided, however much it is

it will not make anything greater; on the contrary it will dry up

the material of the female and destroy it. So fire also does not

continue to make water hotter in proportion as it is itself increased,

but there is a fixed limit to the heat of which water is capable; if

that is once reached and the fire is then increased, the water no

longer gets hotter but rather evaporates and at last disappears and is

dried up. Now since it appears that the secretion of the female and

that from the male need to stand in some proportionate relation to one

another  (I mean in animals of which the male emits semen),  what

happens in those that produce many young is this: from the very

first the semen emitted by the male has power, being divided, to

form several embryos, and the material contributed by the female is so

much that several can be formed out of it.  (The parallel of

curdling milk, which we spoke of before, is no longer in point here,

for what is formed by the heat of the semen is not only of a certain

quantity but also of a certain quality, whereas with fig-juice and

rennet quantity alone is concerned.)  This then is just the reason why

in such animals the embryos formed are numerous and do not all unite

into one whole; it is because an embryo is not formed out of any

quantity you please, but whether there is too much or too little, in

either case there will be no result, for there is a limit set alike to

the power of the heat which acts on the material and to the material

so acted upon.

  On the same principle many embryos are not formed, though the

secretion is much, in the large animals which produce only one young

one, for in them also both the material and that which works upon it

are of a certain quantity. So then they do not secrete such material

in too great quantity for the reason previously stated, and what

they do secrete is naturally just enough for one embryo alone to be

formed from it. If ever too much is secreted, then twins are born.

Hence such cases seem to be more portentous, because they are contrary

to the general and customary rule.

  Man belongs to all three classes, for he produces one only and

sometimes many or few, though naturally he almost always produces one.

Because of the moisture and heat of his body he may produce many  [for

semen is naturally fluid and hot],  but because of his size he

produces few or one. On account of this it results that in man alone

among animals the period of gestation is irregular; whereas the period

is fixed in the rest, there are several periods in man, for children

are born at seven months and at ten months and at the times between,

for even those of eight months do live though less often than the

rest. The reason may be gathered from what has just been said, and the

question has been discussed in the Problems. Let this explanation

suffice for these points.

  The cause why the parts may be multiplied contrary to Nature is

the same as the cause of the birth of twins. For the reason exists

already in the embryo, whenever it aggregates more material at any

point of itself than is required by the nature of the part. The result

is then that either one of its parts is larger than the others, as a

finger or hand or foot or any of the other extremities or limbs; or

again if the embryo is cleft there may come into being more than one

such part, as eddies do in rivers; as the water in these is carried

along with a certain motion, if it dash against anything two systems

or eddies come into being out of one, each retaining the same

motion; the same thing happens also with the embryos. The abnormal

parts generally are attached near those they resemble, but sometimes

at a distance because of the movement- taking place in the embryo, and

especially because of the excess of material returning to that place

whence it was taken away while retaining the form of that part

whence it arose as a superfluity.

  In certain cases we find a double set of generative organs  [one

male and the other female].  When such duplication occurs the one is

always functional but not the other, because it is always

insufficiently supplied with nourishment as being contrary to

Nature; it is attached like a growth  (for such growths also receive

nourishment though they are a later development than the body proper

and contrary to Nature.)  If the formative power prevails, both are

similar; if it is altogether vanquished, both are similar; but if it

prevail here and be vanquished there, then the one is female and the

other male.  (For whether we consider the reason why the whole

animal is male or female, or why the parts are so, makes no

difference.)

  When we meet with deficiency in such parts, e.g. an extremity or one

of the other members, we must assume the same cause as when the embryo

is altogether aborted  (abortion of embryos happens frequently).

  Outgrowths differ from the production of many young in the manner

stated before; monsters differ from these in that most of them are due

to embryos growing together. Some however are also of the following

kind, when the monstrosity affects greater and more sovereign parts,

as for instance some monsters have two spleens or more than two

kidneys. Further, the parts may migrate, the movements which form

the embryo being diverted and the material changing its place. We must

decide whether the monstrous animal is one or is composed of several

grown together by considering the vital principle; thus, if the

heart is a part of such a kind then that which has one heart will be

one animal, the multiplied parts being mere outgrowths, but those

which have more than one heart will be two animals grown together

through their embryos having been confused.

  It also often happens even in many animals that do not seem to be

defective and whose growth is now complete, that some of their

passages may have grown together or others may have been diverted from

the normal course. Thus in some women before now the os uteri has

remained closed, so that when the time for the catamenia has arrived

pain has attacked them, till either the passage has burst open of

its own accord or the physicians have removed the impediment; some

such cases have ended in death if the rupture has been made too

violently or if it has been impossible to make it at all. In some boys

on the other hand the end of the penis has not coincided with the

end of the passage where the urine is voided, but the passage has

ended below, so that they crouch sitting to void it, and if the testes

are drawn up they appear from a distance to have both male and

female generative organs. The passage of the solid food also has

been closed before now in sheep and some other animals; there was a

cow in Perinthus which passed fine matter, as if it were sifted,

through the bladder, and when the anus was cut open it quickly

closed up again nor could they succeed in keeping it open.

  We have now spoken of the production of few and many young, and of

the outgrowth of superfluous parts or of their deficiency, and also of

monstrosities.

                                 5



  Superfoetation does not occur at all in some animals but does in

others; of the former some are able to bring the later formed embryo

to birth, while others can only do so sometimes. The reason why it

does not occur in some is that they produce only one young one, for it

is not found in solid-hoofed animals and those larger than these, as

owing to their size the secretion of the female is all used up for the

one embryo. For all these have large bodies, and when an animal is

large its foetus is large in proportion, e.g. the foetus of the

elephant is as big as a calf. But superfoetation occurs in those which

produce many young because the production of more than one at a

birth is itself a sort of superfoetation, one being added to

another. Of these all that are large, as man, bring to birth the later

embryo, if the second impregnation takes place soon after the first,

for such an event has been observed before now. The reason is that

given above, for even in a single act of intercourse the semen

discharged is more than enough for one embryo, and this being

divided causes more than one child to be born, the one of which is

later than the other. But when the embryo has already grown to some

size and it so happens that copulation occurs again, superfoetation

sometimes takes place, but rarely, since the uterus generally closes

in women during the period of gestation. If this ever happens  (for

this also has occurred)  the mother cannot bring the second embryo

to perfection, but it is cast out in a state like what are called

abortions. For just as, in those animals that bear only one, all the

secretion of the female is converted to the first formed embryo

because of its size, so it is here also; the only difference is that

in the former case this happens at once, in the latter when the foetus

has attained to some size, for then they are in the same state as

those that bear only one. In like manner, since man naturally would

produce many young, and since the size of the uterus and the

quantity of the female secretion are both greater than is necessary

for one embryo, only not so much so as to bring to birth a second,

therefore women and mares are the only animals which admit the male

during gestation, the former for the reason stated, and mares both

because of the barrenness of their nature and because their uterus

is of superfluous size, too large for one but too small to allow a

second embryo to be brought to perfection by superfoetation. And the

mare is naturally inclined to sexual intercourse because she is in the

same case as the barren among women; these latter are barren because

they have no monthly discharge  (which corresponds to the act of

intercourse in males)  and mares have exceedingly little. And in all

the vivipara the barren females are so inclined, because they resemble

the males when the semen has collected in the testes but is not

being got rid of. For the discharge of the catamenia is in females a

sort of emission of semen, they being unconcocted semen as has been

said before. Hence it is that those women also who are incontinent

in regard to such intercourse cease from their passion for it when

they have borne many children, for, the seminal secretion being then

drained off, they no longer desire this intercourse. And among birds

the hens are less disposed that way than the cocks, because the uterus

of the hen-bird is up near the hypozoma; but with the cock-birds it is

the other way, for their testes are drawn up within them, so that,

if any kind of such birds has much semen naturally, it is always in

need of this intercourse. In females then it encourages copulation

to have the uterus low down, but in males to have the testes drawn up.

  It has been now stated why superfoetation is not found in some

animals at all, why it is found in others which sometimes bring the

later embryos to birth and sometimes not, and why some such animals

are inclined to sexual intercourse while others are not.

  Some of those animals in which superfoetation occurs can bring the

embryos to birth even if a long time elapses between the two

impregnations, if their kind is spermatic, if their body is not of a

large size, and if they bear many young. For because they bear many

their uterus is spacious, because they are spermatic the generative

discharge is copious, and because the body is not large but the

discharge is excessive and in greater measure than is required for the

nourishment wanted for the embryo, therefore they can not only form

animals but also bring them to birth later on. Further, the uterus

in such animals does not close up during gestation because there is

a quantity of the residual discharge left over. This has happened

before now even in women, for in some of them the discharge

continues during all the time of pregnancy. In women, however, this is

contrary to Nature, so that the embryo suffers, but in such animals it

is according to Nature, for their body is so formed from the

beginning, as with hares. For superfoetation occurs in these

animals, since they are not large and they bear many young  (for

they have many toes and the many-toed animals bear many),  and they

are spermatic. This is shown by their hairiness, for the quantity of

their hair is excessive, these animals alone having hair under the

feet and within the jaws. Now hairiness is a sign of abundance of

residual matter, wherefore among men also the hairy are given to

sexual intercourse and have much semen rather than the smooth. In

the hare it often happens that some of the embryos are imperfect while

others of its young are produced perfect.

                                 6



  Some of the vivipara produce their young imperfect, others

perfect; the one-hoofed and cloven-footed perfect, most of the

many-toed imperfect. The reason of this is that the one-hoofed produce

one young one, and the cloven-footed either one or two generally

speaking; now it is easy to bring the few to perfection. All the

many-toed animals that bear their young imperfect give birth to

many. Hence, though they are able to nourish the embryos while newly

formed, their bodies are unable to complete the process when the

embryos have grown and acquired some size. So they produce them

imperfect, like those animals which generate a scolex, for some of

them when born are scarcely brought into form at all, as the fox,

bear, and lion, and some of the rest in like manner; and nearly all of

them are blind, as not only the animals mentioned but also the dog,

wolf, and jackal. The pig alone produces both many and perfect

young, and thus here alone we find any overlapping; it produces many

as do the many-toed animals, but is cloven-footed or solid-hoofed

(for there certainly are solid-hoofed swine).  They bear, then, many

young because the nutriment which would otherwise go to increase their

size is diverted to the generative secretion  (for considered as a

solid-hoofed animal the pig is not a large one),  and also it is

more often cloven-hoofed, striving as it were with the nature of the

solid-hoofed animals. For this reason it produces sometimes only

one, sometimes two, but generally many, and brings them to

perfection before birth because of the good condition of its body,

being like a rich soil- which has sufficient and abundant nutriment

for plants.

  The young of some birds also are hatched imperfect, that is to say

blind; this applies to all small birds which lay many eggs, as crows

and rooks, jays, sparrows, swallows, and to all those which lay few

eggs without producing abundant nourishment along with the young, as

ring-doves, turtle-doves, and pigeons. Hence if the eyes of swallows

while still young be put out they recover their sight again, for the

birds are still developing, not yet developed, when the injury is

inflicted, so that the eyes grow and sprout afresh. And in general the

production of young before they are perfect is owing to inability to

continue nourishing them, and they are born imperfect because they are

born too soon. This is plain also with seven-months children, for

since they are not perfected it often happens that even the

passages, e.g. of the ears and nostrils, are not yet opened in some of

them at birth, but only open later as they are growing, and many

such infants survive.

  In man males are more often born defective than females, but in

the other animals this is not the case. The reason is that in man

the male is much superior to the female in natural heat, and so the

male foetus moves about more than the female, and on account of moving

is more liable to injury, for what is young is easily injured since it

is weak. For this same reason also the female foetus is not

perfected equally with the male in man  (but they are so in the

other animals, for in them the female is not later in developing

than the male).  For while within the mother the female takes longer

in developing, but after birth everything is perfected more quickly in

females than in males; I mean, for instance, puberty, the prime of

life, and old age. For females are weaker and colder in nature, and we

must look upon the female character as being a sort of natural

deficiency. Accordingly while it is within the mother it develops

slowly because of its coldness  (for development is concoction, and it

is heat that concocts, and what is hotter is easily concocted);  but

after birth it quickly arrives at maturity and old age on account of

its weakness, for all inferior things come sooner to their

perfection or end, and as this is true of works of art so it is of

what is formed by Nature. For the reason just given also twins are

less likely to survive in man if one be male and one female, but

this is not at all so in the other animals; for in man it is

contrary to Nature that they should run an equal course, as their

development does not take place in equal periods, but the male must

needs be too late or the female too early; in the other animals,

however, it is not contrary to Nature. A difference is also found

between man and the other animals in respect of gestation, for animals

are in better bodily condition most of the time, whereas in most women

gestation is attended with discomfort. Their way of life is partly

responsible for this, for being sedentary they are full of more

residual matter; among nations where the women live a laborious life

gestation is not equally conspicuous and those who are accustomed to

work bear children easily both there and elsewhere; for work

consumes the residual matter, but those who are sedentary have a great

deal of it in them because not only is there no monthly discharge

during pregnancy but also they do no work; therefore their travail

is painful. But work exercises them so that they can hold their

breath, upon which depends the ease or difficulty of child-birth.

These circumstances then, as we have said, contribute to cause the

difference between women and the other animals in this state, but

the most important thing is this: in some animals the discharge

corresponding to the catamenia is but small, and in some not visible

at all, but in women it is greater than in any other animal, so that

when this discharge ceases owing to pregnancy they are troubled

(for if they are not pregnant they are afflicted with ailments

whenever the catamenia do not occur);  and they are more troubled as a

rule at the beginning of pregnancy, for the embryo is able indeed to

stop the catamenia but is too small at first to consume any quantity

of the secretion; later on it takes up some of it and so alleviates

the mother. In the other animals, on the contrary, the residual matter

is but small and so corresponds with the growth of the foetus, and

as the secretions which hinder nourishment are being consumed by the

foetus the mother is in better bodily condition than usual. The same

holds good also with aquatic animals and birds. If it ever happens

that the body of the mother is no longer in good condition when the

foetus is now becoming large, the reason is that its growth needs more

nourishment than the residual matter supplies.  (In some few women

it happens that the body is in a better state during pregnancy;

these are women in whose body the residual matter is small so that

it is all used up along with the nourishment that goes to the foetus.)

                                 7



  We must also speak of what is known as mola uteri, which occurs

rarely in women but still is found sometimes during pregnancy. For

they produce what is called a mola; it has happened before now to a

woman, after she had had intercourse with her husband and supposed she

had conceived, that at first the size of her belly increased and

everything else happened accordingly, but yet when the time for

birth came on, she neither bore a child nor was her size reduced,

but she continued thus for three or four years until dysentery came

on, endangering her life, and she produced a lump of flesh which is

called mola. Moreover this condition may continue till old age and

death. Such masses when expelled from the body become so hard that

they can hardly be cut through even by iron. Concerning the cause of

this phenomenon we have spoken in the Problems; the same thing happens

to the embryo in the womb as to meats half cooked in roasting, and

it is not due to heat, as some say, but rather to the weakness of

the maternal heat.  (For their nature seems to be incapable, and

unable to perfect or to put the last touches to the process of

generation. Hence it is that the mola remains in them till old age

or at any rate for a long time, for in its nature it is neither

perfect nor altogether a foreign body.)  It is want of concoction that

is the reason of its hardness, as with half-cooked meat, for this

half-dressing of meat is also a sort of want of concoction.

  A difficulty is raised as to why this does not occur in other

animals, unless indeed it does occur and has entirely escaped

observation. We must suppose the reason to be that woman alone among

animals is subject to troubles of the uterus, and alone has a

superfluous amount of catamenia and is unable to concoct them; when,

then, the embryo has been formed of a liquid hard to concoct, then

comes the so-called mola into being, and this happens naturally in

women alone or at any rate more than in other animals.

                                 8



  Milk is formed in the females of all internally viviparous

animals, becoming useful for the time of birth. For Nature has made it

for the sake of the nourishment of animals after birth, so that it may

neither fail at this time at all nor yet be at all superfluous; this

is just what we find happening, unless anything chance contrary to

Nature. In the other animals the period of gestation does not vary,

and so the milk is concocted in time to suit this moment, but in

man, since there are several times of birth, it must be ready at the

first of these; hence in women the milk is useless before the

seventh month and only then becomes useful. That it is only

concocted at the last stages is what we should expect to happen also

as being due to a necessary cause. For at first such residual matter

when secreted is used up for the development of the embryo; now the

nutritious part in all things is the sweetest and the most

concocted, and thus when all such elements are removed what remains

must become of necessity bitter and ill-flavoured. As the embryo is

perfecting, the residual matter left over increases in quantity

because the part consumed by the embryo is less; it is also sweeter

since the easily concocted part is less drawn away from it. For it

is no longer expended on moulding the embryo but only on slightly

increasing its growth, it being now fixed because it has reached

perfection  (for in a sense there is a perfection even of an embryo).

Therefore it comes forth from the mother and changes its mode of

development, as now possessing what belongs to it; and no longer takes

that which does not belong to it; and it is at this season that the

milk becomes useful.

  The milk collects in the upper part of the body and the breasts

because of the original plan of the organism. For the part above the

hypozoma is the sovereign part of the animal, while that below is

concerned with nourishment and residual matter, in order that all

animals which move about may contain within themselves nourishment

enough to make them independent when they move from one place to

another. From this upper part also is produced the generative

secretion for the reason mentioned in the opening of our discussion.

But both the secretion of the male and the catamenia of the female are

of a sanguineous nature, and the first principle of this blood and

of the blood-vessels is the heart, and the heart is in this part of

the body. Therefore it is here that the change of such a secretion

must first become plain. This is why the voice changes in both sexes

when they begin to bear seed  (for the first principle of the voice

resides there, and is itself changed when its moving cause changes).

 At the same time the parts about the breasts are raised visibly

even in males but still more in females, for the region of the breasts

becomes empty and spongy in them because so much material is drained

away below. This is so not only in women but also in those animals

which have the mammae low down.

  This change in the voice and the parts about the mammae is plain

even in other creatures to those who have experience of each kind of

animal, but is most remarkable in man. The reason is that in man the

production of secretion is greatest in both sexes in proportion to

their size as compared with other animals; I mean that of the

catamenia in women and the emission of semen in men. When,

therefore, the embryo no longer takes up the secretion in question but

yet prevents its being discharged from the mother, it is necessary

that the residual matter should collect in all those empty parts which

are set upon the same passages. And such is the position of the mammae

in each kind of animals for both causes; it is so both for the sake of

what is best and of necessity.

  It is here, then, that the nourishment in animals is now formed

and becomes thoroughly concocted. As for the cause of concoction, we

may take that already given, or we may take the opposite, for it is

a reasonable view also that the embryo being larger takes more

nourishment, so that less is left over about this time, and the less

is concocted more quickly.

  That milk has the same nature as the secretion from which each

animal is formed is plain, and has been stated previously. For the

material which nourishes is the same as that from which Nature forms

the animal in generation. Now this is the sanguineous liquid in the

sanguinea, and milk is blood concocted  (not corrupted; Empedocles

either mistook the fact or made a bad metaphor when he composed the

line: 'On the tenth day of the eighth month the milk comes into being,

a white pus', for putrefaction and concoction are opposite things, and

pus is a kind of putrefaction but milk is concocted).  While women are

suckling children the catamenia do not occur according to Nature,

nor do they conceive; if they do conceive, the milk dries up. This

is because the nature of the milk and of the catamenia is the same,

and Nature cannot be so productive as to supply both at once; if the

secretion is diverted in the one direction it must needs cease in

the other, unless some violence is done contrary to the general

rule. But this is as much as to say that it is contrary to Nature, for

in all cases where it is not impossible for things to be otherwise

than they generally are but where they may so happen, still what is

the general rule is what is 'according to Nature'.

  The time also at which the young animal is born has been well

arranged. For when the nourishment coming through the umbilical cord

is no longer sufficient for the foetus because of its size, then at

the same time the milk becomes useful for the nourishment of the

newly-born animal, and the blood-vessels round which the so-called

umbilical cord lies as a coat collapse as the nourishment is no longer

passing through it; for these reasons it is at that time also that the

young animal enters into the world.

                                 9



  The natural birth of all animals is head-foremost, because the parts

above the umbilical cord are larger than those below. The body then,

being suspended from the cord as in a balance, inclines towards the

heavy end, and the larger parts are the heavier.

                                10



  The period of gestation is, as a matter of fact, determined

generally in each animal in proportion to the length of its life. This

we should expect, for it is reasonable that the development of the

long-lived animals should take a longer time. Yet this is not the

cause of it, but the periods only correspond accidentally for the most

part; for though the larger and more perfect sanguinea do live a

long time, yet the larger are not all longer-lived. Man lives a longer

time than any animal of which we have any credible experience except

the elephant, and yet the human kind is smaller than that of the

bushy-tailed animals and many others. The real cause of long life in

any animal is its being tempered in a manner resembling the environing

air, along with certain other circumstances of its nature, of which we

will speak later; but the cause of the time of gestation is the size

of the offspring. For it is not easy for large masses to arrive at

their perfection in a small time, whether they be animals or, one

may say, anything else whatever. That is why horses and animals akin

to them, though living a shorter time than man, yet carry their

young longer; for the time in the former is a year, but in the

latter ten months at the outside. For the same reason also the time is

long in elephants; they carry their young two years on account of

their excessive size.

  We find, as we might expect, that in all animals the time of

gestation and development and the length of life aims at being

measured by naturally complete periods. By a natural period I mean,

e.g. a day and night, a month, a year, and the greater times

measured by these, and also the periods of the moon, that is to say,

the full moon and her disappearance and the halves of the times

between these, for it is by these that the moon's orbit fits in with

that of the sun  [the month being a period common to both].

  The moon is a first principle because of her connexion with the

sun and her participation in his light, being as it were a second

smaller sun, and therefore she contributes to all generation and

development. For heat and cold varying within certain limits make

things to come into being and after this to perish, and it is the

motions of the sun and moon that fix the limit both of the beginning

and of the end of these processes. Just as we see the sea and all

bodies of water settling and changing according to the movement or

rest of the winds, and the air and winds again according to the course

of the sun and moon, so also the things which grow out of these or are

in these must needs follow suit. For it is reasonable that the periods

of the less important should follow those of the more important. For

in a sense a wind, too, has a life and birth and death.

  As for the revolutions of the sun and moon, they may perhaps

depend on other principles. It is the aim, then, of Nature to

measure the coming into being and the end of animals by the measure of

these higher periods, but she does not bring this to pass accurately

because matter cannot be easily brought under rule and because there

are many principles which hinder generation and decay from being

according to Nature, and often cause things to fall out contrary to

Nature.

  We have now spoken of the nourishment of animals within the mother

and of their birth into the world, both of each kind separately and of

all in common.
