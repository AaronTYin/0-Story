  WE have now spoken about the sterility of mules, and about those

animals which are viviparous both externally and within themselves.

The generation of the oviparous sanguinea is to a certain extent

similar to that of the animals that walk, and all may be embraced in

the same general statement; but in other respects there are

differences in them both as compared with each other and with those

that walk. All alike are generated from sexual union, the male

emitting semen into the female. But among the ovipara (1) birds

produce a perfect hard-shelled egg, unless it be injured by disease,

and the eggs of birds are all two-coloured. (2) The cartilaginous

fishes, as has been often said already, are oviparous internally but

produce the young alive, the egg changing previously from one part

of the uterus to another; and their egg is soft-shelled and of one

colour. One of this class alone does not produce the young from the

egg within itself, the so-called 'frog'; the reason of which must be

stated later. (3) All other oviparous fishes produce an egg of one

colour, but this is imperfect, for its growth is completed outside the

mother's body by the same cause as are those eggs which are

perfected within.

  Concerning the uterus of these classes of animals, what

differences there are among them and for what reasons, has been stated

previously. For in some of the viviparous creatures it is high up near

the hypozoma, in others low down by the pudenda; the former in the

cartilaginous fishes, the latter in animals both internally and

externally viviparous, such as man and horse and the rest; in the

ovipara it is sometimes low, as in the oviparous fish, and sometimes

high, as in birds.

  Some embryos are formed in birds spontaneously, which are called

wind-eggs and 'zephyria' by some; these occur in birds which are not

given to flight nor rapine but which produce many young, for these

birds have much residual matter, whereas in the birds of prey all such

secretion is diverted to the wings and wing-feathers, while the body

is small and dry and hot.  (The secretion corresponding in hen-birds

to catamenia, and the semen of the cock, are residues.)  Since then

both the wings and the semen are made from residual matter, nature

cannot afford to spend much upon both. And for this same reason the

birds of prey are neither given to treading much nor to laying many

eggs, as are the heavy birds and those flying birds whose bodies are

bulky, as the pigeon and so forth. For such residual matter is

secreted largely in the heavy birds not given to flying, such as

fowls, partridges, and so on, wherefore their males tread often and

their females produce much material. Of such birds some lay many

eggs at a time and some lay often; for instance, the fowl, the

partridge, and the Libyan ostrich lay many eggs, while the pigeon

family do not lay many but lay often. For these are between the

birds of prey and the heavy ones; they are flyers like the former, but

have bulky bodies like the latter; hence, because they are flyers

and the residue is diverted that. way, they lay few eggs, but they lay

often because of their having bulky bodies and their stomachs being

hot and very active in concoction, and because moreover they can

easily procure their food, whereas the birds of prey do so with

difficulty.

  Small birds also tread often and are very fertile, as are

sometimes small plants, for what causes bodily growth in others turn

in them to a seminal residuum. Hence the Adrianic fowls lay most eggs,

for because of the smallness of their bodies the nutriment is used

up in producing young. And other birds are more fertile than

game-fowl, for their bodies are more fluid and bulkier, whereas

those of game-fowl are leaner and drier, since a passionate spirit

is found rather in such bodies as the latter. Moreover the thinness

and weakness of the legs contribute to making the former class of

birds naturally inclined to tread and to be fertile, as we find also

in the human species; for the nourishment which otherwise goes to

the legs is turned in such into a seminal secretion, what Nature takes

from the one place being added at the other. Birds of prey, on the

contrary, have a strong walk and their legs are thick owing to their

habits, so that for all these reasons they neither tread nor lay much.

The kestrel is the most fertile; for this is nearly the only bird of

prey which drinks, and its moisture, both innate and acquired, along

with its heat is favourable to generative products. Even this bird

does not lay very many eggs, but four at the outside.

  The cuckoo, though not a bird of prey, lays few eggs, because it

is of a cold nature, as is shown by the cowardice of the bird, whereas

a generative animal should be hot and moist. That it is cowardly is

plain, for it is pursued by all the birds and lays eggs in the nests

of others.

  The pigeon family are in the habit of laying two for the most

part, for they neither lay one  (no bird does except the cuckoo, and

even that sometimes lays two)  nor yet many, but they frequently

produce two, or three at the most generally two, for this number

lies between one and many.

  It is plain from the facts that with the birds that lay many eggs

the nutriment is diverted to the semen. For most trees, if they bear

too much fruit, wither away after the crop when nutriment is not

reserved for themselves, and this seems to be what happens to annuals,

as leguminous plants, corn, and the like. For they consume all their

nutriment to make seed, their kind being prolific. And some fowls

after laying too much, so as even to lay two eggs in a day, have

died after this. For both the birds the plants become exhausted, and

this condition is an excess of secretion of residual matter. A similar

condition is the cause of the later sterility of the lioness, for at

the first birth she produces five or six, then in the next year

four, and again three cubs, then the next number down to one, then

none at all, showing that the residue is being used up and the

generative secretion is failing along with the advance of years.

  We have now stated in which birds wind-eggs are found, and also what

sort of birds lay many eggs or few, and for what reasons. And

wind-eggs, as said before, come into being because while it is the

material for generation that exists in the female of all animals,

birds have no discharge of catamenia like viviparous sanguinea  (for

they occur in all these latter, more in some, less in others, and in

some only enough in quantity just to mark the class).  The same

applies to fish as to birds, and so in them as in birds is found an

embryonic formation without impregnation, but it is less obvious

because their nature is colder. The secretion corresponding to the

catamenia of vivipara is formed in birds at the appropriate season for

the discharge of superfluous matter, and, because the region near

the hypozoma is hot, it is perfected so far as size is concerned,

but in birds and fishes alike it is imperfect for generation without

the seminal fluid of the male; the cause of this has been previously

given. Wind-eggs are not formed in the flying birds, for the same

reason as prevents their laying many eggs; for the residual matter

in birds of prey is small, and they need the male to give an impulse

for the discharge of it. The wind-eggs are produced in greater numbers

than the impregnated but smaller in size for one and the same

reason; they are smaller in size because they are imperfect, and

because they are smaller in size they are more in number. They are

less pleasant for food because they are less concocted, for in all

foods the concocted is more agreeable. It has been sufficiently

observed, then, that neither birds' nor fishes' eggs are perfected for

generation without the males. As for embryos being formed in fish also

 (though in a less degree)  without the males, the fact has been

observed especially in river fish, for some are seen to have eggs from

the first, as has been written in the Enquiries concerning them. And

generally speaking in the case of birds even the impregnated eggs

are not wont for the most part to attain their full growth unless

the hen be trodden continually. The reason of this is that just as

with women intercourse with men draws down the secretion of the

catamenia  (for the uterus being heated attracts the moisture and

the passages are opened),  so this happens also with birds; the

residual matter corresponding to the catamenia advances a little at

a time, and is not discharged externally, because its amount is

small and the uterus is high up by the hypozoma, but trickles together

into the uterus itself. For as the embryo of the vivipara grows by

means of the umbilical cord, so the egg grows through this matter

flowing to it through the uterus. For when once the hens have been

trodden, they all continue to have eggs almost without intermission,

though very small ones. Hence some are wont to speak of wind-eggs as

not coming into being independently but as mere relics from a previous

impregnation. But this is a false view, for sufficient observations

have been made of their arising without impregnation in chickens and

goslings. Also the female partridges which are taken out to act as

decoys, whether they have ever been impregnated or not, immediately on

smelling the male and hearing his call, become filled with eggs in the

latter case and lay them in the former. The reason why this happens is

the same as in men and quadrupeds, for if their bodies chance to be in

rut they emit semen at the mere sight of the female or at a slight

touch. And such birds are of a lascivious and fertile nature, so

that the impulse they need is but small when they are in this

excited condition, and the secreting activity takes place quickly in

them, wind-eggs forming in the unimpregnated and the eggs in those

which have been impregnated growing and reaching perfection swiftly.

  Among creatures that lay eggs externally birds produce their egg

perfect, fish imperfect, but the eggs of the latter complete their

growth outside as has been said before. The reason is that the fish

kind is very fertile; now it is impossible for many eggs to reach

completion within the mother and therefore they lay them outside. They

are quickly discharged, for the uterus of externally oviparous

fishes is near the generative passage. While the eggs of birds are

two-coloured, those of all fish are one-coloured. The cause of the

double colour may be seen from considering the power of each of the

two parts, the white and the yolk. For the matter of the egg is

secreted from the blood  [No bloodless animal lays eggs,]  and that

the blood is the material of the body has been often said already. The

one part, then, of the egg is nearer the form of the animal coming

into being, that is the hot part; the more earthy part gives the

substance of the body and is further removed. Hence in all

two-coloured eggs the animal receives the first principle of

generation from the white  (for the vital principle is in that which

is hot),  but the nutriment from the yolk. Now in animals of a

hotter nature the part from which the first principle arises is

separated off from the part from which comes the nutriment, the one

being white and the other yellow, and the white and pure is always

more than the yellow and earthy; but in the moister and less hot the

yolk is more in quantity and more fluid. This is what we find in

lake birds, for they are of a moister nature and are colder than the

land birds, so that the so-called 'lecithus' or yolk in the eggs of

such birds is large and less yellow because the white is less

separated off from it. But when we come to the ovipara which are

both of a cold nature and also moister  (such is the fish kind)  we

find the white not separated at all because of the small size of the

eggs and the quantity of the cold and earthy matter; therefore all

fish eggs are of one colour, and white compared with yellow, yellow

compared with white. Even the wind-eggs of birds have this distinction

of colour, for they contain that out of which will come each of the

two parts, alike that whence arises the principle of life and that

whence comes the nutriment; only both these are imperfect and need the

influence of the male in addition; for wind-eggs become fertile if

impregnated by the male within a certain period. The difference in

colour, however, is not due to any difference of sex, as if the

white came from the male, the yolk from the female; both on the

contrary come from the female, but the one is cold, the other hot.

In all cases then where the hot part is considerable it is separated

off, but where it is little it cannot be so; hence the eggs of such

animals, as has been said, are of one colour. The semen of the male

only puts them into form; and therefore at first the egg in birds

appears white and small, but as it advances it is all yellow as more

of the sanguineous material is continually mixed with it; finally as

the hot part is separated the white takes up a position all round it

and equally distributed on all sides, as when a liquid boils; for

the white is naturally liquid and contains in itself the vital heat;

therefore it is separated off all round, but the yellow and earthy

part is inside. And if we enclose many eggs together in a bladder or

something of the kind and boil them over a fire so as not to make

the movement of the heat quicker than the separation of the white

and yolk in the eggs, then the same process takes place in the whole

mass of the eggs as in a single egg, all the yellow part coming into

the middle and the white surrounding it.

  We have thus stated why some eggs are of one colour and others of

two.

                                 2



  The principle of the male is separated off in eggs at the point

where the egg is attached to the uterus, and the reason why the

shape of two-coloured eggs is unsymmetrical, and not perfectly round

but sharper at one end, is that the part of the white in which is

contained this principle must differ from the rest. Therefore the

egg is harder at this point than below, for it is necessary to shelter

and protect this principle. And this is why the sharp end of the egg

comes out of the hen later than the blunt end; for the part attached

to the uterus comes out later, and the egg is attached at the point

where is the said principle, and the principle is in the sharp end.

The same is the case also in the seeds of plants; the principle of the

seed is attached sometimes to the twig, sometimes to the husk,

sometimes to the pericarp. This is plain in the leguminous plants, for

where the two cotyledons of beans and of similar seeds are united,

there is the seed attached to the parent plant, and there is the

principle of the seed.

  A difficulty may be raised about the growth of the egg; how is it

derived from the uterus? For if animals derive their nutriment through

the umbilical cord, through what do eggs derive it? They do not,

like a scolex, acquire their growth by their own means. If there is

anything by which they are attached to the uterus, what becomes of

this when the egg is perfected? It does not come out with the egg as

the cord does with animals; for when its egg is perfected the shell

forms all round it. This problem is rightly raised, but it is not

observed that the shell is at first only a soft membrane, and that

it is only after the egg is perfected that it becomes hard and

brittle; this is so nicely adjusted that it is still soft when it

comes out  (for otherwise it would cause pain in laying),  but no

sooner has it come out than it is fixed hard by cooling, the

moisture quickly evaporating because there is but little of it, and

the earthy part remaining. Now at first a certain part of this

membrane at the sharp end of eggs resembles an umbilical cord, and

projects like a pipe from them while they are still small. It is

plainly visible in small aborted eggs, for if the bird be drenched

with water or suddenly chilled in any other way and cast out the egg

too soon, it appears still sanguineous and with a small tail like an

umbilical cord running through it. As the egg becomes larger this is

more twisted round and becomes smaller, and when the egg is

perfected this end is the sharp end. Under this is the inner

membrane which separates the white and the yolk from this. When the

egg is perfected, the whole of it is set free, and naturally the

umbilical cord does not appear, for it is now the extreme end of the

egg itself.

  The egg is discharged in the opposite way from the young of

vivipara; the latter are born head-first, the part where is the

first principle leading, but the egg is discharged as it were feet

first; the reason of this being what has been stated, that the egg

is attached to the uterus at the point where is the first principle.

  The young bird is produced out of the egg by the mother's incubating

and aiding the concoction, the creature developing out of part of

the egg, and receiving growth and completion from the remaining

part. For Nature not only places the material of the creature in the

egg but also the nourishment sufficient for its growth; for since

the mother bird cannot perfect her young within herself she produces

the nourishment in the egg along with it. Whereas the nourishment,

what is called milk, is produced for the young of vivipara in

another part, in the breasts, Nature does this for birds in the egg.

The opposite, however, is the case to what people think and what is

asserted by Alcmaeon of Crotona. For it is not the white that is the

milk, but the yolk, for it is this that is the nourishment of the

chick, whereas they think it is the white because of the similarity of

colour.

  The chick then, as has been said, comes into being by the incubation

of the mother; yet if the temperature of the season is favourable,

or if the place in which the eggs happen to lie is warm, the eggs

are sufficiently concocted without incubation, both those of birds and

those of oviparous quadrupeds. For these all lay their eggs upon the

ground, where they are concocted by the heat in the earth. Such

oviparous quadrupeds as do visit their eggs and incubate do so

rather for the sake of protecting them than of incubation.

  The eggs of these quadrupeds are formed in the same way as those

of birds, for they are hard-shelled and two-coloured, and they are

formed near the hypozoma as are those of birds, and in all other

respects resemble them both internally and externally, so that the

inquiry into their causes is the same for all. But whereas the eggs of

quadrupeds are hatched out by the mere heat of the weather owing to

their strength, those of birds are more exposed to destruction and

need the mother-bird. Nature seems to wish to implant in animals a

special sense of care for their young: in the inferior animals this

lasts only to the moment of giving birth to the incompletely developed

animal; in others it continues till they are perfect; in all that

are more intelligent, during the bringing up of the young also. In

those which have the greatest portion in intelligence we find

familiarity and love shown also towards the young when perfected, as

with men and some quadrupeds; with birds we find it till they have

produced and brought up their young, and therefore if the hens do

not incubate after laying they get into worse condition, as if

deprived of something natural to them.

  The young is perfected within the egg more quickly in sunshiny

weather, the season aiding in the work, for concoction is a kind of

heat. For the earth aids in the concoction by its heat, and the

brooding hen does the same, for she applies the heat that is within

her. And it is in the hot season, as we should expect, that the eggs

are more apt to be spoilt and the so-called 'uria' or rotten eggs

are produced; for just as wines turn sour in the heats from the

sediment rising  (for this is the cause of their being spoilt),  so is

it with the yolk in eggs, for the sediment and yolk are the earthy

part in each case, wherefore the wine becomes turbid when the sediment

mixes with it, and the like applies to the eggs that are spoiling

because of the yolk. It is natural then that such should be the case

with the birds that lay many eggs, for it is not easy to give the

fitting amount of heat to all, but  (while some have too little)

others have too much and this makes them turbid, as it were by

putrefaction. But this happens none the less with the birds of prey

though they lay few eggs, for often one of the two becomes rotten, and

the third practically always, for being of a hot nature they make

the moisture in the eggs to overboil so to say. For the nature of

the white is opposed to that of the yolk; the yolk congeals in

frosts but liquefies on heating, and therefore it liquefies on

concoction in the earth or by reason of incubation, and becoming

liquid serves as nutriment for the developing chick. If exposed to

heat and roasted it does not become hard, because though earthy in

nature it is only so in the same way as wax is; accordingly on heating

too much the eggs become watery and rotten,  [if they be not from a

liquid residue].  The white on the contrary is not congealed by

frost but rather liquefies  (the reason of which has been stated

before),  but on exposure to heat becomes solid. Therefore being

concocted in the development of the chick it is thickened. For it is

from this that the young is formed  (whereas the yolk turns to

nutriment)  and it is from this that the parts derive their growth

as they are formed one after another. This is why the white and the

yolk are separated by membranes, as being different in nature. The

precise details of the relation of the parts to one another both at

the beginning of generation and as the animals are forming, and also

the details of the membranes and umbilical cords, must be learnt

from what has been written in the Enquiries; for the present

investigation it is sufficient to understand this much clearly,

that, when the heart has been first formed and the great

blood-vessel has been marked off from it, two umbilical cords run from

the vessel, the one to the membrane which encloses the yolk, the other

to the membrane resembling a chorion which surrounds the whole embryo;

this latter runs round on the inside of the membrane of the shell.

Through the one of these the embryo receives the nutriment from the

yolk, and the yolk becomes larger, for it becomes more liquid by

heating. This is because the nourishment, being of a material

character in its first form, must become liquid before it can be

absorbed, just as it is with plants, and at first this embryo, whether

in an egg or in the mother's uterus, lives the life of a plant, for it

receives its first growth and nourishment by being attached to

something else.

  The second umbilical cord runs to the surrounding chorion. For we

must understand that, in the case of animals developed in eggs, the

chick has the same relation to the yolk as the embryo of the

vivipara has to the mother so long as it is within the mother  (for

since the nourishment of the embryo of the ovipara is not completed

within the mother, the embryo takes part of it away from her).  So

also the relation of the chick to the outermost membrane, the

sanguineous one, is like that of the mammalian embryo to the uterus.

At the same time the egg-shell surrounds both the yolk and the

membrane analogous to the uterus, just as if it should be put round

both the embryo itself and the whole of the mother, in the vivipara.

This is so because the embryo must be in the uterus and attached to

the mother. Now in the vivipara the uterus is within the mother, but

in the ovipara it is the other way about, as if one should say that

the mother was in the uterus, for that which comes from the mother,

the nutriment, is the yolk. The reason is that the process of

nourishment is not completed within the mother.

  As the creature grows the umbilicus running the chorion collapses

first, because it is here that the young is to come out; what is

left of the yolk, and the umbilical cord running to the yolk, collapse

later. For the young must have nourishment as soon as it is hatched;

it is not nursed by the mother and cannot immediately procure its

nourishment for itself; therefore the yolk enters within it along with

its umbilicus and the flesh grows round it.

  This then is the manner in which animals produced from perfect

eggs are hatched in all those, whether birds or quadrupeds, which

lay the egg with a hard shell. These details are plainer in the larger

creatures; in the smaller they are obscure because of the smallness of

the masses concerned.

                                 3



  The class of fishes is also oviparous. Those among them which have

the uterus low down lay an imperfect egg for the reason previously

given,' but the so-called 'selache' or cartilaginous fishes produce

a perfect egg within themselves but are externally viviparous except

one which they call the 'frog'; this alone lays a perfect egg

externally. The reason is the nature of its body, for its head is many

times as large as the rest of the body and is spiny and very rough.

This is also why it does not receive its young again within itself nor

produce them alive to begin with, for as the size and roughness of the

head prevents their entering so it would prevent their exit. And while

the egg of the cartilaginous fishes is soft-shelled  (for they

cannot harden and dry its circumference, being colder than birds),

the egg of the frog-fish alone is solid and firm to protect it

outside, but those of the rest are of a moist and soft nature, for

they are sheltered within and by the body of the mother.

  The young are produced from the egg in the same way both with

those externally perfected  (the frog-fishes)  and those internally,

and the process in these eggs is partly similar to, partly different

from that in birds' eggs. In the first place they have not the

second umbilicus which runs to the chorion under the surrounding

shell. The reason of this is that they have not the surrounding shell,

for it is no use to them since the mother shelters them, and the shell

is a protection to the eggs against external injury between laying and

hatching out. Secondly, the process in these also begins on the

surface of the egg but not where it is attached to the uterus, as in

birds, for the chick is developed from the sharp end and that is where

the egg was attached. The reason is that the egg of birds is separated

from the uterus before it is perfected, but in most though not all

cartilaginous fishes the egg is still attached to the uterus when

perfect. While the young develops upon the surface the egg is consumed

by it just as in birds and the other animals detached from the uterus,

and at last the umbilicus of the now perfect fish is left attached

to the uterus. The like is the case with all those whose eggs are

detached from the uterus, for in some of them the egg is so detached

when it is perfect.

  The question may be asked why the development of birds and

cartilaginous fishes differs in this respect. The reason is that in

birds the white and yolk are separate, but fish eggs are one-coloured,

the corresponding matter being completely mixed, so that there is

nothing to stop the first principle being at the opposite end, for the

egg is of the same nature both at the point of attachment and at the

opposite end, and it is easy to draw the nourishment from the uterus

by passages running from this principle. This is plain in the eggs

which are not detached, for in some of the cartilaginous fish the

egg is not detached from the uterus, but is still connected with it as

it comes downwards with a view to the production of the young alive;

in these the young fish when perfected is still connected by the

umbilicus to the uterus when the egg has been consumed. From this it

is clear that previously also, while the egg was still round the

young, the passages ran to the uterus. This happens as we have said in

the 'smooth hound'.

  In these respects and for the reasons given the development of

cartilaginous fishes differs from that of birds, but otherwise it

takes place in the same way. For they have the one umbilicus in like

manner as that of birds connecting with the yolk,- only in these

fishes it connects with the whole egg  (for it is not divided into

white and yolk but all one-coloured),-  and get their nourishment from

this, and as it is being consumed the flesh in like manner

encroaches upon and grows round it.

  Such is the process of development in those fish that produce a

perfect egg within themselves but are externally viviparous.

                                 4



  Most of the other fish are externally oviparous, all laying an

imperfect egg except the frog-fish; the reason of this exception has

been previously stated, and the reason also why the others lay

imperfect eggs. In these also the development from the egg runs on the

same lines as that of the cartilaginous and internally oviparous

fishes, except that the growth is quick and from small beginnings

and the outside of the egg is harder. The growth of the egg is like

that of a scolex, for those animals which produce a scolex give

birth to a small thing at first and this grows by itself and not

through any attachment to the parent. The reason is similar to that of

the growth of yeast, for yeast also grows great from a small beginning

as the more solid part liquefies and the liquid is aerated. This is

effected in animals by the nature of the vital heat, in yeasts by

the heat of the juice commingled with them. The eggs then grow of

necessity through this cause  (for they have in them superfluous

yeasty matter),  but also for the sake of a final cause, for it is

impossible for them to attain their whole growth in the uterus because

these animals have so many eggs. Therefore are they very small when

set free and grow quickly, small because the uterus is narrow for

the multitude of the eggs, and growing quickly that the race may not

perish, as it would if much of the time required for the whole

development were spent in this growth; even as it is most of those

laid are destroyed before hatching. Hence the class of fish is

prolific, for Nature makes up for the destruction by numbers. Some

fish actually burst because of the size of the eggs, as the fish

called 'belone', for its eggs are large instead of numerous, what

Nature has taken away in number being added in size.

  So much for the growth of such eggs and its reason.

                                 5



  A proof that these fish also are oviparous is the fact that even

viviparous fish, such as the cartilaginous, are first internally

oviparous, for hence it is plain that the whole class of fishes is

oviparous. Where, however, both sexes exist and the eggs are

produced in consequence of impregnation, the eggs do not arrive at

completion unless the male sprinkle his milt upon them. Some

erroneously assert that all fish are female except in the

cartilaginous fishes, for they think that the females of fish differ

from what are supposed to be males only in the same way as in those

plants where the one bears fruit but the other is fruitless, as

olive and oleaster, fig and caprifig. They think the like applies to

fish except the cartilaginous, for they do not dispute the sexes in

these. And yet there is no difference in the males of cartilaginous

fishes and those belonging to the oviparous class in respect of the

organs for the milt, and it is manifest that semen can be squeezed out

of males of both classes at the right season. The female also has a

uterus. But if the whole class were females and some of them

unproductive  (as with mules in the class of bushy-tailed animals),

then not only should those which lay eggs have a uterus but also the

others, only the uterus of the latter should be different from that of

the former. But, as it is, some of them have organs for milt and

others have a uterus, and this distinction obtains in all except

two, the erythrinus and the channa, some of them having the milt

organs, others a uterus. The difficulty which drives some thinkers

to this conclusion is easily solved if we look at the facts. They

say quite correctly that no animal which copulates produces many

young, for of all those that generate from themselves perfect

animals or perfect eggs none is prolific on the same scale as the

oviparous fishes, for the number of eggs in these is enormous. But

they had overlooked the fact that fish-eggs differ from those of birds

in one circumstance. Birds and all oviparous quadrupeds, and any of

the cartilaginous fish that are oviparous, produce a perfect egg,

and it does not increase outside of them, whereas the eggs of fish are

imperfect and do so complete their growth. Moreover the same thing

applies to cephalopods also and crustacea, yet these animals are

actually seen copulating, for their union lasts a long time, and it is

plain in these cases that the one is male and the other has a

uterus. Finally, it would be strange if this distinction did not exist

in the whole class, just as male and female in all the vivipara. The

cause of the ignorance of those who make this statement is that the

differences in the copulation and generation of various animals are of

all kinds and not obvious, and so, speculating on a small induction,

they think the same must hold good in all cases.

  So also those who assert that conception in female fishes is

caused by their swallowing the semen of the male have not observed

certain points when they say this. For the males have their milt and

the females their eggs at about the same time of year, and the

nearer the female is to laying the more abundant and the more liquid

is the milt formed in the male. And just as the increase of the milt

in the male and of the roe in the female takes place at the same time,

so is it also with their emission, for neither do the females lay

all their eggs together, but gradually, nor do the males emit all

the milt at once. All these facts are in accordance with reason. For

just as the class of birds in some cases has eggs without

impregnation, but few and seldom, impregnation being generally

required, so we find the same thing, though to a less degree, in fish.

But in both classes these spontaneous eggs are infertile unless the

male, in those kinds where the male exists, shed his fluid upon

them. Now in birds this must take place while the eggs are still

within the mother, because they are perfect when discharged, but in

fish, because the eggs are imperfect and complete their growth outside

the mother in all cases, those outside are preserved by the sprinkling

of the milt over them, even if they come into being by impregnation,

and here it is that the milt of the males is used up. Therefore it

comes down the ducts and diminishes in quantity at the same time as

this happens to the eggs of the females, for the males always attend

them, shedding their milt upon the eggs as they are laid. Thus then

they are male and female, and all of them copulate  (unless in any

kind the distinction of sex does not exist),  and without the semen of

the male no such animal comes into being.

  What helps in the deception is also the fact that the union of

such fishes is brief, so that it is not observed even by many of the

fishermen, for none of them ever watches anything of the sort for

the sake of knowledge. Nevertheless their copulation has been seen,

for fish  [when the tail part does not prevent it]  copulate like

the dolphins by throwing themselves alongside of one another. But

the dolphins take longer to get free again, whereas such fishes do

so quickly. Hence, not seeing this, but seeing the swallowing of the

milt and the eggs, even the fishermen repeat the same simple tale,

so much noised abroad, as Herodotus the storyteller, as if fish were

conceived by the mother's swallowing the milt,- not considering that

this is impossible. For the passage which enters by way of the mouth

runs to the intestines, not to the uterus, and what goes into the

intestines must be turned into nutriment, for it is concocted; the

uterus, however, is plainly full of eggs, and from whence did they

enter it?

                                 6



  A similar story is told also of the generation of birds. For there

are some who say that the raven and the ibis unite at the mouth, and

among quadrupeds that the weasel brings forth its young by the

mouth; so say Anaxagoras and some of the other physicists, speaking

too superficially and without consideration. Concerning the birds,

they are deceived by a false reasoning, because the copulation of

ravens is seldom seen, but they are often seen uniting with one

another with their beaks, as do all the birds of the raven family;

this is plain with domesticated jackdaws. Birds of the pigeon kind

do the same, but, because they also plainly copulate, therefore they

have not had the same legend told of them. But the raven family is not

amorous, for they are birds that produce few young, though this bird

also has been seen copulating before now. It is a strange thing,

however, that these theorists do not ask themselves how the semen

enters the uterus through the intestine, which always concocts

whatever comes into it, as the nutriment; and these birds have a

uterus like others, and eggs are found them near the hypozoma. And the

weasel has a uterus in like manner to the other quadrupeds; by what

passage is the embryo to get from it to the mouth? But this opinion

has arisen because the young of the weasel are very small like those

of the other fissipeds, of which we shall speak later, and because

they often carry the young about in their mouths.

  Much deceived also are those who make a foolish statement about

the trochus and the hyena. Many say that the hyena, and Herodorus

the Heracleot says that the trochus, has two pudenda, those of the

male and of the female, and that the trochus impregnates itself but

the hyena mounts and is mounted in alternate years. This is untrue,

for the hyena has been seen to have only one pudendum, there being

no lack of opportunity for observation in some districts, but hyenas

have under the tail a line like the pudendum of the female. Both

male and female have such a mark, but the males are taken more

frequently; this casual observation has given rise to this opinion.

But enough has been said of this.

                                 7



  Touching the generation of fish, the question may be raised, why

it is that in the cartilaginous fish neither the females are seen

discharging their eggs nor the males their milt, whereas in the

non-viviparous fishes this is seen in both sexes. The reason is that

the whole cartilaginous class do not produce much semen, and further

the females have their uterus near hypozoma. For the males and females

of the one class of fish differ from the males and females of the

other class in like manner, for the cartilaginous are less

productive of semen. But in the oviparous fish, as the females lay

their eggs on account of their number, so do the males shed their milt

on account of its abundance. For they have more milt than just what is

required for copulation, as Nature prefers to expend the milt in

helping to perfect the eggs, when the female has deposited them,

rather than in forming them at first. For as has been said both

further back and in our recent discussions, the eggs of birds are

perfected internally but those of fish externally. The latter, indeed,

resemble in a way those animals which produce a scolex, for the

product discharged by them is still more imperfect than a fish's

egg. It is the male that brings about the perfection of the egg both

of birds and of fishes, only in the former internally, as they are

perfected internally, and in the latter externally, because the egg is

imperfect when deposited; but the result is the same in both cases.

  In birds the wind-eggs become fertile, and those previously

impregnated by one kind of cock change their nature to that of the

later cock. And if the eggs be behindhand in growth, then, if the same

cock treads the hen again after leaving off treading for a time, he

causes them to increase quickly, not, however, at any period

whatever of their development, but if the treading take place before

the egg changes so far that the white begins to separate from the

yolk. But in the eggs of fishes no such limit of time has been laid

down, but the males shed their milt quickly upon them to preserve

them. The reason is that these eggs are not two-coloured, and hence

there is no such limit of time fixed with them as with those of birds.

This fact is what we should expect, for by the time that the white and

yolk are separated off from one another, the birds egg already

contains the principle that comes from the male parent.... for the

male contributes to this.

  Wind-eggs, then, participate in generation so far as is possible for

them. That they should be perfected into an animal is impossible,

for an animal requires sense-perception; but the nutritive faculty

of the soul is possessed by females as well as males, and indeed by

all living things, as has been often said, wherefore the egg itself is

perfect only as the embryo of a plant, but imperfect as that of an

animal. If, then, there had been no male sex in the class of birds,

the egg would have been produced as it is in some fishes, if indeed

there is any kind of fish of such a nature as to generate without a

male; but it has been said of them before that this has not yet been

satisfactorily observed. But as it is both sexes exist in all birds,

so that, considered as a plant, the egg is perfect, but in so far as

it is not a plant it is not perfect, nor does anything else result

from it; for neither has it come into being simply like a real plant

nor from copulation like an animal. Eggs, however, produced from

copulation but already separated into white and yolk take after the

first cock; for they already contain both principles, which is why

they do not change again after the second impregnation.

                                 8



  The young are produced in the same way also by the cephalopoda, e.g.

sepias and the like, and by the crustacea, e.g. carabi and their

kindred, for these also lay eggs in consequence of copulation, and the

male has often been seen uniting with the female. Therefore those

who say that all fish are female and lay eggs without copulation are

plainly speaking unscientifically from this point of view also. For it

is a wonderful thing to suppose that the former animals lay eggs in

consequence of copulation and that fish do not; if again they were

unaware of this, it is a sign of ignorance. The union of all these

creatures lasts a considerable time, as in insects, and naturally

so, for they are bloodless and therefore of a cold nature.

  In the sepias and calamaries or squids the eggs appear to be two,

because the uterus is divided and appears double, but that of the

poulps appears to be single. The reason is that the shape of the

uterus in the poulp is round in form and spherical, the cleavage being

obscure when it is filled with eggs. The uterus of the carabi is

also bifid. All these animals also lay an imperfect egg for the same

reason as fishes. In the carabi and their like the females produce

their eggs so as to keep them attached to themselves, which is why the

side-flaps of the females are larger than those of the males, to

protect the eggs; the cephalopoda lay them away from themselves. The

males of the cephalopoda sprinkle their milt over the females, as

the male fish do over the eggs, and it becomes a sticky and

glutinous mass, but in the carabi and their like nothing of the sort

has been seen or can be naturally expected, for the egg is under the

female and is hard-shelled. Both these eggs and those of the

cephalopoda grow after deposition like those of fishes.

  The sepia while developing is attached to the egg by its front part,

for here alone is it possible, because this animal alone has its front

and back pointing in the same direction. For the position and attitude

of the young while developing you must look at the Enquiries.

                                9



  We have now spoken of the generation of other animals, those that

walk, fly, and swim; it remains to speak of insects and testacea

according to the plan laid down. Let us begin with the insects. It was

observed previously that some of these are generated by copulation,

others spontaneously, and besides this that they produce a scolex, and

why this is so. For pretty much all creatures seem in a certain way to

produce a scolex first, since the most imperfect embryo is of such a

nature; and in all animals, even the viviparous and those that lay a

perfect egg, the first embryo grows in size while still

undifferentiated into parts; now such is the nature of the scolex.

After this stage some of the ovipara produce the egg in a perfect

condition, others in an imperfect, but it is perfected outside as

has been often stated of fish. With animals internally viviparous

the embryo becomes egg-like in a certain sense after its original

formation, for the liquid is contained in a fine membrane, just as

if we should take away the shell of the egg, wherefore they call the

abortion of an embryo at that stage an 'efflux'.

  Those insects which generate at all generate a scolex, and those

which come into being spontaneously and not from copulation do so at

first from a formation this nature. I say that the former generate a

scolex, for we must put down caterpillars also and the product of

spiders as a sort of scolex. And yet some even of these and many of

the others may be thought to resemble eggs because of their round

shape, but we must not judge by shapes nor yet by softness and

hardness  (for what is produced by some is hard),  but by the fact

that the whole of them is changed into the body of the creature and

the animal is not developed from a part of them. All these products

that are of the nature of a scolex, after progressing and acquiring

their full size, become a sort of egg, for the husk about them hardens

and they are motionless during this period. This is plain in the

scolex of bees and wasps and in caterpillars. The reason of this is

that their nature, because of its imperfection, oviposits as it were

before the right time, as if the scolex, while still growing in

size, were a soft egg. Similar to this is also what happens with all

other insects which come into being without copulation in wool and

other such materials and in water. For all of them after the scolex

stage become immovable and their integument dries round them, and

after this the latter bursts and there comes forth as from an egg an

animal perfected in its second metamorphosis, most of those which

are not aquatic being winged.

  Another point is quite natural, which may wondered at by many.

Caterpillars at first take nourishment, but after this stage do so

no longer, but what is called by some the chrysalis is motionless. The

same applies to the scolex of wasps and bees, but after this comes

into being the so-called nymph.... and have nothing of the kind. For

an egg is also of such a nature that when it has reached perfection it

grows no more in size, but at first it grows and receives

nourishment until it is differentiated and becomes a perfect egg.

Sometimes the scolex contains in itself the material from which it

is nourished and obtains such an addition to its size, e.g. in bees

and wasps; sometimes it gets its nourishment from outside itself, as

caterpillars and some others.

  It has thus been stated why such animals go through a double

development and for what reason they become immovable again after

moving. And some of them come into being by copulation, like birds and

vivipara and most fishes, others spontaneously, like some plants.

                                10



  There is much difficulty about the generation of bees. If it is

really true that in the case of some fishes there is such a method

of generation that they produce eggs without copulation, this may well

happen also with bees, to judge from appearances. For they must (1)

either bring the young brood from elsewhere, as some say, and if so

the young must either be spontaneously generated or produced by some

other animal, or (2) they must generate them themselves, or (3) they

must bring some and generate others, for this also is maintained by

some, who say that they bring the young of the drones only. Again,

if they generate them it must be either with or without copulation; if

the former, then either (1) each kind must generate its own kind, or

(2) some one kind must generate the others, or (3) one kind must unite

with another for the purpose  (I mean for instance (1) that bees may

be generated from the union of bees, drones from that of drones, and

kings from that of kings, or (2) that all the others may be

generated from one, as from what are called kings and leaders, or

(3) from the union of drones and bees, for some say that the former

are male, the latter female, while others say that the bees are male

and the drones female).  But all these views are impossible if we

reason first upon the facts peculiar to bees and secondly upon those

which apply more generally to other animals also.

  For if they do not generate the young but bring them from elsewhere,

then bees ought to come into being also, if the bees did not carry

them off, in the places from which the old bees carry the germs. For

why, if new bees come into existence when the germs are transported,

should they not do so if the germs are left there? They ought to do so

just as much, whether the germs are spontaneously generated in the

flowers or whether some animal generates them. And if the germs were

of some other animal, then that animal ought to be produced from

them instead of bees. Again, that they should collect honey is

reasonable, for it is their food, but it is strange that they should

collect the young if they are neither their own offspring nor food.

With what object should they do so? for all animals that trouble

themselves about the young labour for what appears to be their own

offspring.

  But, again, it is also unreasonable to suppose that the bees are

female and the drones male, for Nature does not give weapons for

fighting to any female, and while the drones are stingless all the

bees have a sting. Nor is the opposite view reasonable, that the

bees are male and the drones female, for no males are in the habit

of working for their offspring, but as it is the bees do this. And

generally, since the brood of the drones is found coming into being

among them even if there is no mature drone present, but that of the

bees is not so found without the presence of the kings  (which is

why some say that the young of the drones alone is brought in from

outside),  it is plain that they are not produced from copulation,

either (1) of bee with bee or drone with drone or (2) of bees with

drones.  (That they should import the brood of the drones alone is

impossible for the reasons already given, and besides it is

unreasonable that a similar state of things should not prevail with

all the three kinds if it prevails with one.)  Then, again, it is also

impossible that the bees themselves should be some of them male and

some female, for in all kinds of animals the two sexes differ. Besides

they would in that case generate their own kind, but as it is their

brood is not found to come into being if the leaders are not among

them, as men say. And an argument against both theories, that the

young are generated by union of the bees with one another or with

the drones, separately or with one another, is this: none of them

has ever yet been seen copulating, whereas this would have often

happened if the sexes had existed in them. It remains then, if they

are generated by copulation at all, that the kings shall unite to

generate them. But the drones are found to come into being even if

no leaders are present, and it is not possible that the bees should

either import their brood or themselves generate them by copulation.

It remains then, as appears to be the case in certain fishes, that the

bees should generate the drones without copulation, being indeed

female in respect of generative power, but containing in themselves

both sexes as plants do. Hence also they have the instrument of

offence, for we ought not to call that female in which the male sex is

not separated. But if this is found to be the case with drones, if

they come into being without copulation, then as it is necessary

that the same account should be given of the bees and the kings and

that they also should be generated without copulation. Now if the

brood of the bees had been found to come into being among them without

the presence of the kings, it would necessarily follow that the bees

also are produced from bees themselves without copulation, but as it

is, since those occupied with the tendance of these creatures deny

this, it remains that the kings must generate both their own kind

and the bees.

  As bees are a peculiar and extraordinary kind of animal so also

their generation appears to be peculiar. That bees should generate

without copulation is a thing which may be paralleled in other

animals, but that what they generate should not be of the same kind is

peculiar to them, for the erythrinus generates an erythrinus and the

channa a channa. The reason is that bees themselves are not

generated like flies and similar creatures, but from a kind

different indeed but akin to them, for they are produced from the

leaders. Hence in a sort of way their generation is analogous. For the

leaders resemble the drones in size and the bees in possessing a

sting; so the bees are like them in this respect, and the drones are

like them in size. For there must needs be some overlapping unless the

same kind is always to be produced from each; but this is

impossible, for at that rate the whole class would consist of leaders.

The bees, then, are assimilated to them their power of generation, the

drones in size; if the latter had had a sting also they would have

been leaders, but as it is this much of the difficulty has been

solved, for the leaders are like both kinds at once, like the bees

in possessing a sting, like the drones in size.

  But the leaders also must be generated from something. Since it is

neither from the bees nor from the drones, it must be from their own

kind. The grubs of the kings are produced last and are not many in

number.

  Thus what happens is this: the leaders generate their own kind but

also another kind, that of the bees; the bees again generate another

kind, the drones, but do not also generate their own kind, but this

has been denied them. And since what is according to Nature is

always in due order, therefore it is necessary that it should be

denied to the drones even to generate another kind than themselves.

This is just what we find happening, for though the drones are

themselves generated, they generate nothing else, but the process

reaches its limit in the third stage. And so beautifully is this

arranged by Nature that the three kinds always continue in existence

and none of them fails, though they do not all generate.

  Another fact is also natural, that in fine seasons much honey is

collected and many drones are produced but in rainy reasons a large

brood of ordinary bees. For the wet causes more residual matter to

be formed in the bodies of the leaders, the fine weather in that of

the bees, for being smaller in size they need the fine weather more

than the kings do. It is right also that the kings, being as it were

made with a view to producing young, should remain within, freed

from the labour of procuring necessaries, and also that they should be

of a considerable size, their bodies being, as it were, constituted

with a view to bearing young, and that the drones should be idle as

having no weapon to fight for the food and because of the slowness

of their bodies. But the bees are intermediate in size between the two

other kinds, for this is useful for their work, and they are workers

as having to support not only their young but also their fathers.

And it agrees with our views that the bees attend upon their kings

because they are their offspring  (for if nothing of the sort had been

the case the facts about their leadership would be unreasonable),  and

that, while they suffer the kings to do no work as being their

parents, they punish the drones as their children, for it is nobler to

punish one's children and those who have no work to perform. The

fact that the leaders, being few, generate the bees in large numbers

seems to be similar to what obtains in the generation of lions,

which at first produce five, afterwards a smaller number each time

at last one and thereafter none. So the leaders at first produce a

number of workers, afterwards a few of their own kind; thus the

brood of the latter is smaller in number than that of the former,

but where Nature has taken away from them in number she has made it up

again in size.

  Such appears to be the truth about the generation of bees, judging

from theory and from what are believed to be the facts about them; the

facts, however, have not yet been sufficiently grasped; if ever they

are, then credit must be given rather to observation than to theories,

and to theories only if what they affirm agrees with the observed

facts.

  A further indication that bees are produced without copulation is

the fact that the brood appears small in the cells of the comb,

whereas, whenever insects are generated by copulation, the parents

remain united for a long time but produce quickly something of the

nature of a scolex and of a considerable size.

  Concerning the generation of animals akin to them, as hornets and

wasps, the facts in all cases are similar to a certain extent, but are

devoid of the extraordinary features which characterize bees; this

we should expect, for they have nothing divine about them as the

bees have. For the so-called 'mothers' generate the young and mould

the first part of the combs, but they generate by copulation with

one another, for their union has often been observed. As for all the

differences of each of these kind from one another and from bees, they

must be investigated with the aid of the illustrations to the

Enquiries.

                                11



  Having spoken of the generation of all insects, we must now speak of

the testacea. Here also the facts of generation are partly like and

partly unlike those in the other classes. And this is what might be

expected. For compared with animals they resemble plants, compared

with plants they resemble animals, so that in a sense they appear to

come into being from semen, but in another sense not so, and in one

way they are spontaneously generated but in another from their own

kind, or some of them in the latter way, others in the former. Because

their nature answers to that of plants, therefore few or no kinds of

testacea come into being on land, e.g. the snails and any others,

few as they are, that resemble them; but in the sea and similar waters

there are many of all kinds of forms. But the class of plants has

but few and one may say practically no representatives in the sea

and such places, all such growing on the land. For plants and testacea

are analogous; and in proportion as liquid has more quickening power

than solid, water than earth, so much does the nature of testacea

differ from that of plants, since the object of testacea is to be in

such a relation to water as plants are to earth, as if plants were, so

to say, land-oysters, oysters water-plants.

  For such a reason also the testacea in the water vary more in form

than those on the land. For the nature of liquid is more plastic

than that of earth and yet not much less material, and this is

especially true of the inhabitants of the sea, for fresh water, though

sweet and nutritious, is cold and less material. Wherefore animals

having no blood and not of a hot nature are not produced in lakes

nor in the fresher among brackish waters, but only exceptionally,

but it is in estuaries and at the mouths of rivers that they come into

being, as testacea and cephalopoda and crustacea, all these being

bloodless and of a cold nature. For they seek at the same time the

warmth of the sun and food; now the sea is not only water but much

more material than fresh water and hot in its nature; it has a share

in all the parts of the universe, water and air and earth, so that

it also has a share in all living things which are produced in

connexion with each of these elements. Plants may be assigned to land,

the aquatic animals to water, the land animals to air, but

variations of quantity and distance make a great and wonderful

difference. The fourth class must not be sought in these regions,

though there certainly ought to be some animal corresponding to the

element of fire, for this is counted in as the fourth of the

elementary bodies. But the form which fire assumes never appears to be

peculiar to it, but it always exists in some other of the elements,

for that which is ignited appears to be either air or smoke or

earth. Such a kind of animal must be sought in the moon, for this

appears to participate in the element removed in the third degree from

earth. The discussion of these things however belongs to another

subject.

  To return to testacea, some of them are formed spontaneously, some

emit a sort of generative substance from themselves, but these also

often come into being from a spontaneous formation. To understand this

we must grasp the different methods of generation in plants; some of

these are produced from seed, some from slips, planted out, some by

budding off alongside, as the class of onions. In the last way

produced mussels, for smaller ones are always growing off alongside

the original, but the whelks, the purple-fish, and those which are

said to 'spawn' emit masses of a liquid slime as if originated by

something of a seminal nature. We must not, however, consider that

anything of the sort is real semen, but that these creatures

participate in the resemblance to plants in the manner stated above.

Hence when once one such creature has been produced, then is

produced a number of them. For all these creatures are liable to be

even spontaneously generated, and so to be formed still more

plentifully in proportion if some are already existing. For it is

natural that each should have some superfluous residue attached to

it from the original, and from this buds off each of the creatures

growing alongside of it. Again, since the nutriment and its residue

possess a like power, it is likely that the product of those

testacea which 'spawn' should resemble the original formation, and

so it is natural that a new animal of the same kind should come into

being from this also.

  All those which do not bud off or 'spawn' are spontaneously

generated. Now all things formed in this way, whether in earth or

water, manifestly come into being in connexion with putrefaction and

an admixture of rain-water. For as the sweet is separated off into the

matter which is forming, the residue of the mixture takes such a form.

Nothing comes into being by putrefying, but by concocting;

putrefaction and the thing putrefied is only a residue of that which

is concocted. For nothing comes into being out of the whole of

anything, any more than in the products of art; if it did art would

have nothing to do, but as it is in the one case art removes the

useless material, in the other Nature does so. Animals and plants come

into being in earth and in liquid because there is water in earth, and

air in water, and in all air is vital heat so that in a sense all

things are full of soul. Therefore living things form quickly whenever

this air and vital heat are enclosed in anything. When they are so

enclosed, the corporeal liquids being heated, there arises as it

were a frothy bubble. Whether what is forming is to be more or less

honourable in kind depends on the embracing of the psychical

principle; this again depends on the medium in which the generation

takes place and the material which is included. Now in the sea the

earthy matter is present in large quantities, and consequently the

testaceous animals are formed from a concretion of this kind, the

earthy matter hardening round them and solidifying in the same

manner as bones and horns  (for these cannot be melted by fire),

and the matter  (or body)  which contains the life being included

within it.

  The class of snails is the only class of such creatures that has

been seen uniting, but it has never yet been sufficiently observed

whether their generation is the result of the union or not.

  It may be asked, if we wish to follow the right line of

investigation, what it is in such animals the formation of which

corresponds to the material principle. For in the females this is a

residual secretion of the animal, potentially such as that from

which it came, by imparting motion to which the principle derived from

the male perfects the animal. But here what must be said to correspond

to this, and whence comes or what is the moving principle which

corresponds to the male? We must understand that even in animals which

generate it is from the incoming nourishment that the heat in the

animal makes the residue, the beginning of the conception, by

secretion and concoction. The like is the case also in plants,

except that in these  (and also in some animals)  there is no

further need of the male principle, because they have it mingled

with the female principle within themselves, whereas the residual

secretion in most animals does need it. The nourishment again of

some is earth and water, of others the more complicated combinations

of these, so that what the heat in animals produces from their

nutriment, this does the heat of the warm season in the environment

put together and combine by concoction out of the sea-water on the

earth. And the portion of the psychical principle which is either

included along with it or separated off in the air makes an embryo and

puts motion into it. Now in plants which are spontaneously generated

the method of formation is uniform; they arise from a part of

something, and while some of it is the starting-point of the plant,

some is the first nourishment of the young shoots.... Other animals

are produced in the form of a scolex, not only those bloodless animals

which are not generated from parents but even some sanguinea, as a

kind of mullet and some other river fishes and also the eel kind.

For all of these, though they have but little blood by nature, are

nevertheless sanguinea, and have a heart with blood in it as the

origin of the parts; and the so-called 'entrails of earth', in which

comes into being the body of the eel, have the nature of a scolex.

  Hence one might suppose, in connexion with the origin of men and

quadrupeds, that, if ever they were really 'earth-born' as some say,

they came into being in one of two ways; that either it was by the

formation of a scolex at first or else it was out of eggs. For

either they must have had in themselves the nutriment for growth  (and

such a conception is a scolex)  or they must have got it from

elsewhere, and that either from the mother or from part of the

conception. If then the former is impossible  (I mean that nourishment

should flow to them from the earth as it does in animals from the

mother),  then they must have got it from some part of the conception,

and such generation we say is from an egg.

  It is plain then that, if there really was any such beginning of the

generation of all animals, it is reasonable to suppose to have been

one of these two, scolex or egg. But it is less reasonable to

suppose that it was from eggs, for we do not see such generation

occurring with any animal, but we do see the other both in the

sanguinea above mentioned and in the bloodless animals. Such are

some of the insects and such are the testacea which we are discussing;

for they do not develop out of a part of something  (as do animals

from eggs),  and they grow like a scolex. For the scolex grows towards

the upper part and the first principle, since in the lower part is the

nourishment for the upper. And this resembles the development of

animals from eggs, except that these latter consume the whole egg,

whereas in the scolex, when the upper part has grown by taking up into

itself part of the substance in the lower part, the lower part is then

differentiated out of the rest. The reason is that in later life

also the nourishment is absorbed by all animals in the part below

the hypozoma.

  That the scolex grows in this way is plain in the case of bees and

the like, for at first the lower part is large in them and the upper

is smaller. The details of growth in the testacea are similar. This is

plain in the whorls of the turbinata, for always as the animal grows

the whorls become larger towards the front and what is called the head

of the creature.

  We have now pretty well described the manner of the development of

these and the other spontaneously generated animals. That all the

testacea are formed spontaneously is clear from such facts as these.

They come into being on the side of boats when the frothy mud

putrefies. In many places where previously nothing of the kind

existed, the so-called limnostrea, a kind of oyster, have come into

being when the spot turned muddy through want of water; thus when a

naval armament cast anchor at Rhodes a number of clay vessels were

thrown out into the sea, and after some time, when mud had collected

round them, oysters used to be found in them. Here is another proof

that such animals do not emit any generative substance from

themselves; when certain Chians carried some live oysters over from

Pyrrha in Lesbos and placed them in narrow straits of the sea where

tides clash, they became no more numerous as time passed, but

increased greatly in size. The so-called eggs contribute to generation

but are only a condition, like fat in the sanguinea, and therefore the

oysters are savoury at these periods. A proof that this substance is

not really eggs is the fact that such 'eggs' are always found in

some testacea, as in pinnae, whelks, and purple-fish; only they are

sometimes larger and sometimes smaller; in others as pectens, mussels,

and the so-called limnostrea, they are not always present but only

in the spring; as the season advances they dwindle and at last

disappear altogether; the reason being that the spring is favourable

to their being in good condition. In others again, as the ascidians,

nothing of the sort is visible.  (The details concerning these last,

and the places in which they come into being, must be learnt from

the Enquiry.)
