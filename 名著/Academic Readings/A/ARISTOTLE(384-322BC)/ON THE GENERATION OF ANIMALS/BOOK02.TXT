  THAT the male and the female are the principles of generation has

been previously stated, as also what is their power and their essence.

But why is it that one thing becomes and is male, another female? It

is the business of our discussion as it proceeds to try and point

out (1) that the sexes arise from Necessity and the first efficient

cause, (2) from what sort of material they are formed. That (3) they

exist because it is better and on account of the final cause, takes us

back to a principle still further remote.

  Now (1) some existing things are eternal and divine whilst others

admit of both existence and non-existence. But (2) that which is noble

and divine is always, in virtue of its own nature, the cause of the

better in such things as admit of being better or worse, and what is

not eternal does admit of existence and non-existence, and can partake

in the better and the worse. And (3) soul is better than body, and

living, having soul, is thereby better than the lifeless which has

none, and being is better than not being, living than not living.

These, then, are the reasons of the generation of animals. For since

it is impossible that such a class of things as animals should be of

an eternal nature, therefore that which comes into being is eternal in

the only way possible. Now it is impossible for it to be eternal as an

individual  (though of course the real essence of things is in the

individual)- were it such it would be eternal- but it is possible

for it as a species. This is why there is always a class of men and

animals and plants. But since the male and female essences are the

first principles of these, they will exist in the existing individuals

for the sake of generation. Again, as the first efficient or moving

cause, to which belong the definition and the form, is better and more

divine in its nature than the material on which it works, it is better

that the superior principle should be separated from the inferior.

Therefore, wherever it is possible and so far as it is possible, the

male is separated from the female. For the first principle of the

movement, or efficient cause, whereby that which comes into being is

male, is better and more divine than the material whereby it is

female. The male, however, comes together and mingles with the

female for the work of generation, because this is common to both.

  A thing lives, then, in virtue of participating in the male and

female principles, wherefore even plants have some kind of life; but

the class of animals exists in virtue of sense-perception. The sexes

are divided in nearly all of these that can move about, for the

reasons already stated, and some of them, as said before, emit semen

in copulation, others not. The reason of this is that the higher

animals are more independent in their nature, so that they have

greater size, and this cannot exist without vital heat; for the

greater body requires more force to move it, and heat is a motive

force. Therefore, taking a general view, we may say that sanguinea are

of greater size than bloodless animals, and those which move about

than those which remain fixed. And these are just the animals which

emit semen on account of their heat and size.

  So much for the cause of the existence of the two sexes. Some

animals bring to perfection and produce into the world a creature like

themselves, as all those which bring their young into the world alive;

others produce something undeveloped which has not yet acquired its

own form; in this latter division the sanguinea lay eggs, the

bloodless animals either lay an egg or give birth to a scolex. The

difference between egg and scolex is this: an egg is that from a

part of which the young comes into being, the rest being nutriment for

it; but the whole of a scolex is developed into the whole of the young

animal. Of the vivipara, which bring into the world an animal like

themselves, some are internally viviparous  (as men, horses, cattle,

and of marine animals dolphins and the other cetacea);  others first

lay eggs within themselves, and only after this are externally

viviparous  (as the cartilaginous fishes).  Among the ovipara some

produce the egg in a perfect condition  (as birds and all oviparous

quadrupeds and footless animals, e.g. lizards and tortoises and most

snakes; for the eggs of all these do not increase when once laid).

The eggs of others are imperfect; such are those of fishes,

crustaceans, and cephalopods, for their eggs increase after being

produced.

  All the vivipara are sanguineous, and the sanguinea are either

viviparous or oviparous, except those which are altogether

infertile. Among bloodless animals the insects produce a scolex, alike

those that are generated by copulation and those that copulate

themselves though not so generated. For there are some insects of this

sort, which though they come into being by spontaneous generation

are yet male and female; from their union something is produced,

only it is imperfect; the reason of this has been previously stated.

  These classes admit of much cross-division. Not all bipeds are

viviparous  (for birds are oviparous),  nor are they all oviparous

(for man is viviparous),  nor are all quadrupeds oviparous  (for

horses, cattle, and countless others are viviparous),  nor are they

all viviparous  (for lizards, crocodiles, and many others lay eggs).

 Nor does the presence or absence of feet make the difference

between them, for not only are some footless animals viviparous, as

vipers and the cartilaginous fishes, while others are oviparous, as

the other fishes and serpents, but also among those which have feet

many are oviparous and many viviparous, as the quadrupeds above

mentioned. And some which have feet, as man, and some which have

not, as the whale and dolphin, are internally viviparous. By this

character then it is not possible to divide them, nor is any of the

locomotive organs the cause of this difference, but it is those

animals which are more perfect in their nature and participate in a

purer element which are viviparous, for nothing is internally

viviparous unless it receive and breathe out air. But the more perfect

are those which are hotter in their nature and have more moisture

and are not earthy in their composition. And the measure of natural

heat is the lung when it has blood in it, for generally those

animals which have a lung are hotter than those which have not, and in

the former class again those whose lung is not spongy nor solid nor

containing only a little blood, but soft and full of blood. And as the

animal is perfect but the egg and the scolex are imperfect, so the

perfect is naturally produced from the more perfect. If animals are

hotter as shown by their possessing a lung but drier in their

nature, or are colder but have more moisture, then they either lay a

perfect egg or are viviparous after laying an egg within themselves.

For birds and scaly reptiles because of their heat produce a perfect

egg, but because of their dryness it is only an egg; the cartilaginous

fishes have less heat than these but more moisture, so that they are

intermediate, for they are both oviparous and viviparous within

themselves, the former because they are cold, the latter because of

their moisture; for moisture is vivifying, whereas dryness is furthest

removed from what has life. Since they have neither feathers nor

scales such as either reptiles or other fishes have, all which are

signs rather of a dry and earthy nature, the egg they produce is soft;

for the earthy matter does not come to the surface in their eggs any

more than in themselves. This is why they lay eggs in themselves,

for if the egg were laid externally it would be destroyed, having no

protection.

  Animals that are cold and rather dry than moist also lay eggs, but

the egg is imperfect; at the same time, because they are of an

earthy nature and the egg they produce is imperfect, therefore it

has a hard integument that it may be preserved by the protection of

the shell-like covering. Hence fishes, because they are scaly, and

crustacea, because they are of an earthy nature, lay eggs with a

hard integument.

  The cephalopods, having themselves bodies of a sticky nature,

preserve in the same way the imperfect eggs they lay, for they deposit

a quantity of sticky material about the embryo. All insects produce

a scolex. Now all the insects are bloodless, wherefore all creatures

that produce a scolex from themselves are so. But we cannot say simply

that all bloodless animals produce a scolex, for the classes overlap

one another, (1) the insects, (2) the animals that produce a scolex,

(3) those that lay their egg imperfect, as the scaly fishes, the

crustacea, and the cephalopoda. I say that these form a gradation, for

the eggs of these latter resemble a scolex, in that they increase

after oviposition, and the scolex of insects again as it develops

resembles an egg; how so we shall explain later.

  We must observe how rightly Nature orders generation in regular

gradation. The more perfect and hotter animals produce their young

perfect in respect of quality  (in respect of quantity this is so with

no animal, for the young always increase in size after birth),  and

these generate living animals within themselves from the first. The

second class do not generate perfect animals within themselves from

the first  (for they are only viviparous after first laying eggs),

but still they are externally viviparous. The third class do not

produce a perfect animal, but an egg, and this egg is perfect. Those

whose nature is still colder than these produce an egg, but an

imperfect one, which is perfected outside the body, as the class of

scaly fishes, the crustacea, and the cephalopods. The fifth and

coldest class does not even lay an egg from itself; but so far as

the young ever attain to this condition at all, it is outside the body

of the parent, as has been said already. For insects produce a

scolex first; the scolex after developing becomes egg-like  (for the

so-called chrysalis or pupa is equivalent to an egg);  then from

this it is that a perfect animal comes into being, reaching the end of

its development in the second change.

  Some animals then, as said before, do not come into being from

semen, but all the sanguinea do so which are generated by

copulation, the male emitting semen into the female when this has

entered into her the young are formed and assume their peculiar

character, some within the animals themselves when they are

viviparous, others in eggs.

  There is a considerable difficulty in understanding how the plant is

formed out of the seed or any animal out of the semen. Everything that

comes into being or is made must (1) be made out of something, (2)

be made by the agency of something, and (3) must become something. Now

that out of which it is made is the material; this some animals have

in its first form within themselves, taking it from the female parent,

as all those which are not born alive but produced as a scolex or an

egg; others receive it from the mother for a long time by sucking,

as the young of all those which are not only externally but also

internally viviparous. Such, then, is the material out of which things

come into being, but we now are inquiring not out of what the parts of

an animal are made, but by what agency. Either it is something

external which makes them, or else something existing in the seminal

fluid and the semen; and this must either be soul or a part of soul,

or something containing soul.

  Now it would appear irrational to suppose that any of either the

internal organs or the other parts is made by something external,

since one thing cannot set up a motion in another without touching it,

nor can a thing be affected in any way by another if it does not set

up a motion in it. Something then of the sort we require exists in the

embryo itself, being either a part of it or separate from it. To

suppose that it should be something else separate from it is

irrational. For after the animal has been produced does this something

perish or does it remain in it? But nothing of the kind appears to

be in it, nothing which is not a part of the whole plant or animal.

Yet, on the other hand, it is absurd to say that it perishes after

making either all the parts or only some of them. If it makes some

of the parts and then perishes, what is to make the rest of them?

Suppose this something makes the heart and then perishes, and the

heart makes another organ, by the same argument either all the parts

must perish or all must remain. Therefore it is preserved and does not

perish. Therefore it is a part of the embryo itself which exists in

the semen from the beginning; and if indeed there is no part of the

soul which does not exist in some part of the body, it would also be a

part containing soul in it from the beginning.

  How, then, does it make the other parts? Either all the parts, as

heart, lung, liver, eye, and all the rest, come into being together or

in succession, as is said in the verse ascribed to Orpheus, for

there he says that an animal comes into being in the same way as the

knitting of a net. That the former is not the fact is plain even to

the senses, for some of the parts are clearly visible as already

existing in the embryo while others are not; that it is not because of

their being too small that they are not visible is clear, for the lung

is of greater size than the heart, and yet appears later than the

heart in the original development. Since, then, one is earlier and

another later, does the one make the other, and does the later part

exist on account of the part which is next to it, or rather does the

one come into being only after the other? I mean, for instance, that

it is not the fact that the heart, having come into being first,

then makes the liver, and the liver again another organ, but that

the liver only comes into being after the heart, and not by the agency

of the heart, as a man becomes a man after being a boy, not by his

agency. An explanation of this is that, in all the productions of

Nature or of art, what already exists potentially is brought into

being only by what exists actually; therefore if one organ formed

another the form and the character of the later organ would have to

exist in the earlier, e.g. the form of the liver in the heart. And

otherwise also the theory is strange and fictitious.

  Yet again, if the whole animal or plant is formed from semen or

seed, it is impossible that any part of it should exist ready made

in the semen or seed, whether that part be able to make the other

parts or no. For it is plain that, if it exists in it from the

first, it was made by that which made the semen. But semen must be

made first, and that is the function of the generating parent. So,

then, it is not possible that any part should exist in it, and

therefore it has not within itself that which makes the parts.

  But neither can this agent be external, and yet it must needs be one

or other of the two. We must try, then, to solve this difficulty,

for perhaps some one of the statements made cannot be made without

qualification, e.g. the statement that the parts cannot be made by

what is external to the semen. For if in a certain sense they

cannot, yet in another sense they can.  (Now it makes no difference

whether we say 'the semen' or 'that from which the semen comes', in so

far as the semen has in itself the movement initiated by the other.)

 It is possible, then, that A should move B, and B move C; that, in

fact, the case should be the same as with the automatic machines shown

as curiosities. For the parts of such machines while at rest have a

sort of potentiality of motion in them, and when any external force

puts the first of them in motion, immediately the next is moved in

actuality. As, then, in these automatic machines the external force

moves the parts in a certain sense  (not by touching any part at the

moment, but by having touched one previously),  in like manner also

that from which the semen comes, or in other words that which made the

semen, sets up the movement in the embryo and makes the parts of it by

having first touched something though not continuing to touch it. In a

way it is the innate motion that does this, as the act of building

builds the house. Plainly, then, while there is something which

makes the parts, this does not exist as a definite object, nor does it

exist in the semen at the first as a complete part.

  But how is each part formed? We must answer this by starting in

the first instance from the principle that, in all products of

Nature or art, a thing is made by something actually existing out of

that which is potentially such as the finished product. Now the

semen is of such a nature, and has in it such a principle of motion,

that when the motion is ceasing each of the parts comes into being,

and that as a part having life or soul. For there is no such thing

as face or flesh without life or soul in it; it is only equivocally

that they will be called face or flesh if the life has gone out of

them, just as if they had been made of stone or wood. And the

homogeneous parts and the organic come into being together. And just

as we should not say that an axe or other instrument or organ was made

by the fire alone, so neither shall we say that foot or hand were made

by heat alone. The same applies also to flesh, for this too has a

function. While, then, we may allow that hardness and softness,

stickiness and brittleness, and whatever other qualities are found

in the parts that have life and soul, may be caused by mere heat and

cold, yet, when we come to the principle in virtue of which flesh is

flesh and bone is bone, that is no longer so; what makes them is the

movement set up by the male parent, who is in actuality what that

out of which the offspring is made is in potentiality. This is what we

find in the products of art; heat and cold may make the iron soft

and hard, but what makes a sword is the movement of the tools

employed, this movement containing the principle of the art. For the

art is the starting-point and form of the product; only it exists in

something else, whereas the movement of Nature exists in the product

itself, issuing from another nature which has the form in actuality.

  Has the semen soul, or not? The same argument applies here as in the

question concerning the parts. As no part, if it participate not in

soul, will be a part except in an equivocal sense  (as the eye of a

dead man is still called an 'eye'),  so no soul will exist in anything

except that of which it is soul; it is plain therefore that semen both

has soul, and is soul, potentially.

  But a thing existing potentially may be nearer or further from its

realization in actuality, as e.g. a mathematician when asleep is

further from his realization in actuality as engaged in mathematics

than when he is awake, and when awake again but not studying

mathematics he is further removed than when he is so studying.

Accordingly it is not any part that is the cause of the soul's

coming into being, but it is the first moving cause from outside.

(For nothing generates itself, though when it has come into being it

thenceforward increases itself.)  Hence it is that only one part comes

into being first and not all of them together. But that must first

come into being which has a principle of increase  (for this nutritive

power exists in all alike, whether animals or plants, and this is

the same as the power that enables an animal or plant to generate

another like itself, that being the function of them all if

naturally perfect).  And this is necessary for the reason that

whenever a living thing is produced it must grow. It is produced,

then, by something else of the same name, as e.g. man is produced by

man, but it is increased by means of itself. There is, then, something

which increases it. If this is a single part, this must come into

being first. Therefore if the heart is first made in some animals, and

what is analogous to the heart in the others which have no heart, it

is from this or its analogue that the first principle of movement

would arise.

  We have thus discussed the difficulties previously raised on the

question what is the efficient cause of generation in each case, as

the first moving and formative power.

                                 2



  The next question to be mooted concerns the nature of semen. For

whereas when it issues from the animal it is thick and white, yet on

cooling it becomes liquid as water, and its colour is that of water.

This would appear strange, for water is not thickened by heat; yet

semen is thick when it issues from within the animal's body which is

hot, and becomes liquid on cooling. Again, watery fluids freeze, but

semen, if exposed in frosts to the open air, does not freeze but

liquefies, as if it was thickened by the opposite of cold. Yet it is

unreasonable, again, to suppose that it is thickened by heat. For it

is only substances having a predominance of earth in their composition

that coagulate and thicken on boiling, e.g. milk. It ought then to

solidify on cooling, but as a matter of fact it does not become

solid in any part but the whole of it goes like water.

  This then is the difficulty. If it is water, water evidently does

not thicken through heat, whereas the semen is thick and both it and

the body whence it issues are hot. If it is made of earth or a mixture

of earth and water, it ought not to liquefy entirely and turn to

water.

  Perhaps, however, we have not discriminated all the possibilities.

It is not only the liquids composed of water and earthy matter that

thicken, but also those composed of water and air; foam, for instance,

becomes thicker and white, and the smaller and less visible the

bubbles in it, the whiter and firmer does the mass appear. The same

thing happens also with oil; on mixing with air it thickens, wherefore

that which is whitening becomes thicker, the watery part in it being

separated off by the heat and turning to air. And if oxide of lead

is mixed with water or even with oil, the mass increases greatly and

changes from liquid and dark to firm and white, the reason being

that air is mixed in with it which increases the mass and makes the

white shine through, as in foam and snow  (for snow is foam).  And

water itself on mingling with oil becomes thick and white, because air

is entangled in it by the act of pounding them together, and oil

itself has much air in it  (for shininess is a property of air, not of

earth or water).  This too is why it floats on the surface of the

water, for the air contained in it as in a vessel bears it up and

makes it float, being the cause of its lightness. So too oil is

thickened without freezing in cold weather and frosts; it does not

freeze because of its heat  (for the air is hot and will not freeze),

but because the air is forced together and compressed, as..., by the

cold, the oil becomes thicker. These are the reasons why semen is firm

and white when it issues from within the animal; it has a quantity

of hot air in it because of the internal heat; afterwards, when the

heat has evaporated and the air has cooled, it turns liquid and

dark; for the water, and any small quantity of earthy matter there may

be, remain in semen as it dries, as they do in phlegm.

  Semen, then, is a compound of spirit  (pneuma)  and water, and the

former is hot air  (aerh);  hence semen is liquid in its nature

because it is made of water. What Ctesias the Cnidian has asserted

of the semen of elephants is manifestly untrue; he says that it

hardens so much in drying that it becomes like amber. But this does

not happen, though it is true that one semen must be more earthy

than another, and especially so with animals that have much earthy

matter in them because of the bulk of their bodies. And it is thick

and white because it is mixed with spirit, for it is also an

invariable rule that it is white, and Herodotus does not report the

truth when he says that the semen of the Aethiopians is black, as if

everything must needs be black in those who have a black skin, and

that too when he saw their teeth were white. The reason of the

whiteness of semen is that it is a foam, and foam is white, especially

that which is composed of the smallest parts, small in the sense

that each bubble is invisible, which is what happens when water and

oil are mixed and shaken together, as said before.  (Even the ancients

seem to have noticed that semen is of the nature of foam; at least

it was from this they named the goddess who presides over union.)

  This then is the explanation of the problem proposed, and it is

plain too that this is why semen does not freeze; for air will not

freeze.

                                 3



  The next question to raise and to answer is this. If, in the case of

those animals which emit semen into the female, that which enters

makes no part of the resulting embryo, where is the material part of

it diverted if  (as we have seen)  it acts by means of the power

residing in it? It is not only necessary to decide whether what is

forming in the female receives anything material, or not, from that

which has entered her, but also concerning the soul in virtue of which

an animal is so called  (and this is in virtue of the sensitive part

of the soul)- does this exist originally in the semen and in the

unfertilized embryo or not, and if it does whence does it come? For

nobody would put down the unfertilized embryo as soulless or in

every sense bereft of life  (since both the semen and the embryo of an

animal have every bit as much life as a plant),  and it is

productive up to a certain point. That then they possess the nutritive

soul is plain  (and plain is it from the discussions elsewhere about

soul why this soul must be acquired first).  As they develop they also

acquire the sensitive soul in virtue of which an animal is an

animal. For e.g. an animal does not become at the same time an

animal and a man or a horse or any other particular animal. For the

end is developed last, and the peculiar character of the species is

the end of the generation in each individual. Hence arises a

question of the greatest difficulty, which we must strive to solve

to the best of our ability and as far as possible. When and how and

whence is a share in reason acquired by those animals that participate

in this principle? It is plain that the semen and the unfertilized

embryo, while still separate from each other, must be assumed to

have the nutritive soul potentially, but not actually, except that

(like those unfertilized embryos that are separated from the mother)

 it absorbs nourishment and performs the function of the nutritive

soul. For at first all such embryos seem to live the life of a

plant. And it is clear that we must be guided by this in speaking of

the sensitive and the rational soul. For all three kinds of soul,

not only the nutritive, must be possessed potentially before they

are possessed in actuality. And it is necessary either (1) that they

should all come into being in the embryo without existing previously

outside it, or (2) that they should all exist previously, or (3), that

some should so exist and others not. Again, it is necessary that

they should either (1) come into being in the material supplied by the

female without entering with the semen of the male, or (2) come from

the male and be imparted to the material in the female. If the latter,

then either all of them, or none, or some must come into being in

the male from outside.

  Now that it is impossible for them all to preexist is clear from

this consideration. Plainly those principles whose activity is

bodily cannot exist without a body, e.g. walking cannot exist

without feet. For the same reason also they cannot enter from outside.

For neither is it possible for them to enter by themselves, being

inseparable from a body, nor yet in a body, for the semen is only a

secretion of the nutriment in process of change. It remains, then, for

the reason alone so to enter and alone to be divine, for no bodily

activity has any connexion with the activity of reason.

  Now it is true that the faculty of all kinds of soul seems to have a

connexion with a matter different from and more divine than the

so-called elements; but as one soul differs from another in honour and

dishonour, so differs also the nature of the corresponding matter. All

have in their semen that which causes it to be productive; I mean what

is called vital heat. This is not fire nor any such force, but it is

the spiritus included in the semen and the foam-like, and the

natural principle in the spiritus, being analogous to the element of

the stars. Hence, whereas fire generates no animal and we do not

find any living thing forming in either solids or liquids under the

influence of fire, the heat of the sun and that of animals does

generate them. Not only is this true of the heat that works through

the semen, but whatever other residuum of the animal nature there

may be, this also has still a vital principle in it. From such

considerations it is clear that the heat in animals neither is fire

nor derives its origin from fire.

  Let us return to the material of the semen, in and with which

comes away from the male the spiritus conveying the principle of soul.

Of this principle there are two kinds; the one is not connected with

matter, and belongs to those animals in which is included something

divine  (to wit, what is called the reason),  while the other is

inseparable from matter. This material of the semen dissolves and

evaporates because it has a liquid and watery nature. Therefore we

ought not to expect it always to come out again from the female or

to form any part of the embryo that has taken shape from it; the

case resembles that of the fig-juice which curdles milk, for this

too changes without becoming any part of the curdling masses.

  It has been settled, then, in what sense the embryo and the semen

have soul, and in what sense they have not; they have it potentially

but not actually.

  Now semen is a secretion and is moved with the same movement as that

in virtue of which the body increases  (this increase being due to

subdivision of the nutriment in its last stage).  When it has

entered the uterus it puts into form the corresponding secretion of

the female and moves it with the same movement wherewith it is moved

itself. For the female's contribution also is a secretion, and has all

the arts in it potentially though none of them actually; it has in

it potentially even those parts which differentiate the female from

the male, for just as the young of mutilated parents are sometimes

born mutilated and sometimes not, so also the young born of a female

are sometimes female and sometimes male instead. For the female is, as

it were, a mutilated male, and the catamenia are semen, only not pure;

for there is only one thing they have not in them, the principle of

soul. For this reason, whenever a wind-egg is produced by any

animal, the egg so forming has in it the parts of both sexes

potentially, but has not the principle in question, so that it does

not develop into a living creature, for this is introduced by the

semen of the male. When such a principle has ben imparted to the

secretion of the female it becomes an embryo.

  Liquid but corporeal substances become surrounded by some kind of

covering on heating, like the solid scum which forms on boiled foods

when cooling. All bodies are held together by the glutinous; this

quality, as the embryo develops and increases in size, is acquired

by the sinewy substance, which holds together the parts of animals,

being actual sinew in some and its analogue in others. To the same

class belong also skin, blood-vessels, membranes, and the like, for

these differ in being more or less glutinous and generally in excess

and deficiency.

                                 4



  In those animals whose nature is comparatively imperfect, when a

perfect embryo  (which, however, is not yet a perfect animal)  has

been formed, it is cast out from the mother, for reasons previously

stated. An embryo is then complete when it is either male or female,

in the case of those animals who possess this distinction, for some

(i.e. all those which are not themselves produced from a male or

female parent nor from a union of the two)  produce an offspring which

is neither male nor female. Of the generation of these we shall

speak later.

  The perfect animals, those internally viviparous, keep the

developing embryo within themselves and in close connexion until

they give birth to a complete animal and bring it to light.

  A third class is externally viviparous but first internally

oviparous; they develop the egg into a perfect condition, and then

in some cases the egg is set free as with creatures externally

oviparous, and the animal is produced from the egg within the mother's

body; in other cases, when the nutriment from the egg is consumed,

development is completed by connection with the uterus, and

therefore the egg is not set free from the uterus. This character

marks the cartilaginous fish, of which we must speak later by

themselves.

  Here we must make our first start from the first class; these are

the perfect or viviparous animals, and of these the first is man.

Now the secretion of the semen takes place in all of them just as does

that of any other residual matter. For each is conveyed to its

proper place without any force from the breath or compulsion of any

other cause, as some assert, saying that the generative parts

attract the semen like cupping-glasses, aided by the force of the

breath, as if it were possible for either this secretion or the

residue of the solid and liquid nutriment to go anywhere else than

they do without the exertion of such a force. Their reason is that the

discharge of both is attended by holding the breath, but this is a

common feature of all cases when it is necessary to move anything,

because strength arises through holding the breath. Why, even

without this force the secretions or excretions are discharged in

sleep if the parts concerned are full of them and are relaxed. One

might as well say that it is by the breath that the seeds of plants

are always segregated to the places where they are wont to bear fruit.

No, the real cause, as has been stated already, is that there are

special parts for receiving all the secretions, alike the useless  (as

the residues of the liquid and solid nutriment),  and the blood, which

has the so-called blood-vessels.

  To consider now the region of the uterus in the female- the two

blood-vessels, the great vessel and the aorta, divide higher up, and

many fine vessels from them terminate in the uterus. These become

over-filled from the nourishment they convey, nor is the female nature

able to concoct it, because it is colder than man's; so the blood is

excreted through very fine vessels into the uterus, these being unable

on account of their narrowness to receive the excessive quantity,

and the result is a sort of haemorrhage. The period is not

accurately defined in women, but tends to return during the waning

of the moon. This we should expect, for the bodies of animals are

colder when the environment happens to become so, and the time of

change from one month to another is cold because of the absence of the

moon, whence also it results that this time is stormier than the

middle of the month. When then the residue of the nourishment has

changed into blood, the catamenia tend to occur at the above-mentioned

period, but when it is not concocted a little matter at a time is

always coming away, and this is why 'whites' appear in females while

still small, in fact mere children. If both these discharges of the

secretions are moderate, the body remains in good health, for they act

as a purification of the secretions which are the causes of a morbid

state of body; if they do not occur at all or if they are excessive,

they are injurious, either causing illness or pulling down the

patient; hence whites, if continuous and excessive, prevent girls from

growing. This secretion then is necessarily discharged by females

for the reasons given; for, the female nature being unable to

concoct the nourishment thoroughly, there must not only be left a

residue of the useless nutriment, but also there must be a residue

in the blood-vessels, and this filling the channels of the finest

vessels must overflow. Then Nature, aiming at the best end, uses it up

in this place for the sake of generation, that another creature may

come into being of the same kind as the former was going to be, for

the menstrual blood is already potentially such as the body from which

it is discharged.

  In all females, then, there must necessarily be such a secretion,

more indeed in those that have blood and of these most of all in

man, but in the others also some matter must be collected in the

uterine region. The reason why there is more in those that have

blood and most in man has been already given, but why, if all

females have such a secretion, have not all males one to correspond?

For some of them do not emit semen but, just as those which do emit it

fashion by the movement in the semen the mass forming from the

material supplied by the female, so do the animals in question bring

the same to pass and exert the same formative power by the movement

within themselves in that part from whence the semen is secreted. This

is the region about the diaphragm in all those animals which have one,

for the heart or its analogue is the first principle of a natural

body, while the lower part is a mere addition for the sake of it.

Now the reason why it is not all males that have a generative

secretion, while all females do, is that the animal is a body with

Soul or life; the female always provides the material, the male that

which fashions it, for this is the power that we say they each

possess, and this is what is meant by calling them male and female.

Thus while it is necessary for the female to provide a body and a

material mass, it is not necessary for the male, because it is not

within the work of art or the embryo that the tools or the maker

must exist. While the body is from the female, it is the soul that

is from the male, for the soul is the reality of a particular body.

For this reason if animals of a different kind are crossed  (and

this is possible when the periods of gestation are equal and

conception takes place nearly at the same season and there is no great

difference in the of the animals),  the first cross has a common

resemblance to both parents, as the hybrid between fox and dog,

partridge and domestic fowl, but as time goes on and one generation

springs from another, the final result resembles the female in form,

just as foreign seeds produce plants varying in accordance with the

country in which they are sown. For it is the soil that gives to the

seeds the material and the body of the plant. And hence the part of

the female which receives the semen is not a mere passage, but the

uterus has a considerable width, whereas the males that emit semen

have only passages for this purpose, and these are bloodless.

  Each of the secretions becomes such at the moment when it is in

its proper place; before that there is nothing of the sort unless with

much violence and contrary to nature.

  We have thus stated the reason for which the generative secretions

are formed in animals. But when the semen from the male  (in those

animals which emit semen)  has entered, it puts into form the purest

part of the female secretion  (for the greater part of the catamenia

also is useless and fluid, as is the most fluid part of the male

secretion, i.e. in a single emission, the earlier discharge being in

most cases apt to be infertile rather than the later, having less

vital heat through want of concoction, whereas that which is concocted

is thick and of a more material nature).

  If there is no external discharge, either in women or other animals,

on account of there not being much useless and superfluous matter in

the secretion, then the quantity forming within the female

altogether is as much as what is retained within those animals which

have an external discharge; this is put into form by the power of

the male residing in the semen secreted by him, or, as is clearly seen

to happen in some insects, by the part in the female analogous to

the uterus being inserted into the male.

  It has been previously stated that the discharge accompanying sexual

pleasure in the female contributes nothing to the embryo. The chief

argument for the opposite view is that what are called bad dreams

occur by night with women as with men; but this is no proof, for the

same thing happens to young men also who do not yet emit semen, and to

those who do emit semen but whose semen is infertile.

  It is impossible to conceive without the emission of the male in

union and without the secretion of the corresponding female

material, whether it be discharged externally or whether there is only

enough within the body. Women conceive, however, without

experiencing the pleasure usual in such intercourse, if the part

chance to be in heat and the uterus to have descended. But generally

speaking the opposite is the case, because the os uteri is not

closed when the discharge takes place which is usually accompanied

by pleasure in women as well as men, and when this is so there is a

readier way for the semen of the male to be drawn into the uterus.

  The actual discharge does not take place within the uterus as some

think, the os uteri being too narrow, but it is in the region in front

of this, where the female discharges the moisture found in some cases,

that the male emits the semen. Sometimes it remains in this place;

at other times, if the uterus chance to be conveniently placed and hot

on account of the purgation of the catamenia, it draws it within

itself. A proof of this is that pessaries, though wet when applied,

are removed dry. Moreover, in all those animals which have the

uterus near the hypozoma, as birds and viviparous fishes, it is

impossible that the semen should be so discharged as to enter it; it

must be drawn into it. This region, on account of the heat which is in

it, attracts the semen. The discharge and collection of the

catamenia also excite heat in this part. Hence it acts like

cone-shaped vessels which, when they have been washed out with hot

water, their mouth being turned downwards, draw water into themselves.

And this is the way things are drawn up, but some say that nothing

of the kind happens with the organic parts concerned in copulation.

Precisely the opposite is the case of those who say the woman emits

semen as well as the man, for if she emits it outside the uterus

this must then draw it back again into itself if it is to be mixed

with the semen of the male. But this is a superfluous proceeding,

and Nature does nothing superfluous.

  When the material secreted by the female in the uterus has been

fixed by the semen of the male  (this acts in the same way as rennet

acts upon milk, for rennet is a kind of milk containing vital heat,

which brings into one mass and fixes the similar material, and the

relation of the semen to the catamenia is the same, milk and the

catamenia being of the same nature)- when, I say, the more solid

part comes together, the liquid is separated off from it, and as the

earthy parts solidify membranes form all round it; this is both a

necessary result and for a final cause, the former because the surface

of a mass must solidify on heating as well as on cooling, the latter

because the foetus must not be in a liquid but be separated from it.

Some of these are called membranes and others choria, the difference

being one of more or less, and they exist in ovipara and vivipara

alike.

  When the embryo is once formed, it acts like the seeds of plants.

For seeds also contain the first principle of growth in themselves,

and when this  (which previously exists in them only potentially)  has

been differentiated, the shoot and the root are sent off from it,

and it is by the root that the plant gets nourishment; for it needs

growth. So also in the embryo all the parts exist potentially in a way

at the same time, but the first principle is furthest on the road to

realization. Therefore the heart is first differentiated in actuality.

This is clear not only to the senses  (for it is so)  but also on

theoretical grounds. For whenever the young animal has been

separated from both parents it must be able to manage itself, like a

son who has set up house away from his father. Hence it must have a

first principle from which comes the ordering of the body at a later

stage also, for if it is to come in from outside at later period to

dwell in it, not only may the question be asked at what time it is

to do so, but also we may object that, when each of the parts is

separating from the rest, it is necessary that this principle should

exist first from which comes growth and movement to the other parts.

 (Wherefore all who say, as did Democritus, that the external parts of

animals are first differentiated and the internal later, are much

mistaken; it is as if they were talking of animals of stone or wood.

For such as these have no principle of growth at all, but all

animals have, and have it within themselves.)  Therefore it is that

the heart appears first distinctly marked off in all the sanguinea,

for this is the first principle or origin of both homogeneous and

heterogeneous parts, since from the moment that the animal or organism

needs nourishment, from that moment does this deserve to be called its

principle or origin. For the animal grows, and the nutriment, in its

final stage, of an animal is the blood or its analogue, and of this

the blood-vessels are the receptacle, wherefore the heart is the

principle or origin of these also.  (This is clear from the

Enquiries and the anatomical drawings.)

  Since the embryo is already potentially an animal but an imperfect

one, it must obtain its nourishment from elsewhere; accordingly it

makes use of the uterus and the mother, as a plant does of the

earth, to get nourishment, until it is perfected to the point of being

now an animal potentially locomotive. So Nature has first designed the

two blood-vessels from the heart, and from these smaller vessels

branch off to the uterus. These are what is called the umbilicus,

for this is a blood-vessel, consisting of one or more vessels in

different animals. Round these is a skin-like integument, because

the weakness of the vessels needs protection and shelter. The

vessels join on to the uterus like the roots of plants, and through

them the embryo receives its nourishment. This is why the animal

remains in the uterus, not, as Democritus says, that the parts of

the embryo may be moulded in conformity with those of the mother. This

is plain in the ovipara, for they have their parts differentiated in

the egg after separation from the matrix.

  Here a difficulty may be raised. If the blood is the nourishment,

and if the heart, which first comes into being, already contains

blood, and the nourishment comes from outside, whence did the first

nourishment enter? Perhaps it is not true that all of it comes from

outside just as in the seeds of plants there is something of this

nature, the substance which at first appears milky, so also in the

material of the animal embryo the superfluous matter of which it is

formed is its nourishment from the first.

  The embryo, then, grows by means of the umbilicus in the same way as

a plant by its roots, or as animals themselves when separated from the

nutriment within the mother, of which we must speak later at the

time appropriate for discussing them. But the parts are not

differentiated, as some suppose, because like is naturally carried

to like. Besides many other difficulties involved in this theory, it

results from it that the homogeneous parts ought to come into being

each one separate from the rest, as bones and sinews by themselves,

and flesh by itself, if one should accept this cause. The real cause

why each of them comes into being is that the secretion of the

female is potentially such as the animal is naturally, and all the

parts are potentially present in it, but none actually. It is also

because when the active and the passive come in contact with each

other in that way in which the one is active and the other passive  (I

mean in the right manner, in the right place, and at the right time),

straightway the one acts and the other is acted upon. The female,

then, provides matter, the male the principle of motion. And as the

products of art are made by means of the tools of the artist, or to

put it more truly by means of their movement, and this is the activity

of the art, and the art is the form of what is made in something else,

so is it with the power of the nutritive soul. As later on in the case

of mature animals and plants this soul causes growth from the

nutriment, using heat and cold as its tools  (for in these is the

movement of the soul),  and each thing comes into being in

accordance with a certain formula, so also from the beginning does

it form the product of nature. For the material by which this latter

grows is the same as that from which it is constituted at first;

consequently also the power which acts upon it is identical with

that which originally generated it; if then this acting power is the

nutritive soul, this is also the generative soul, and this is the

nature of every organism, existing in all animals and plants.  [But

the other parts of the soul exist in some animals, not in others.]  In

plants, then, the female is not separated from the male, but in

those animals in which it is separated the male needs the female

besides.

                                 5



  And yet the question may be raised why it is that, if indeed the

female possesses the same soul and if it is the secretion of the

female which is the material of the embryo, she needs the male besides

instead of generating entirely from herself. The reason is that the

animal differs from the plant by having sense-perception; if the

sensitive soul is not present, either actually or potentially, and

either with or without qualification, it is impossible for face, hand,

flesh, or any other part to exist; it will be no better than a

corpse or part of a corpse. If then, when the sexes are separated,

it is the male that has the power of making the sensitive soul, it

is impossible for the female to generate an animal from itself

alone, for the process in question was seen to involve the male

quality. Certainly that there is a good deal in the difficulty

stated is plain in the case of the birds that lay wind-eggs, showing

that the female can generate up to a certain point unaided. But this

still involves a difficulty; in what way are we to say that their eggs

live? It neither possible that they should live in the same way as

fertile eggs  (for then they would produce a chick actually alive),

nor yet can they be called eggs only in the sense in which an egg of

wood or stone is so called, for the fact that these eggs go bad

shows that they previously participate in some way in life. It is

plain, then, that they have some soul potentially. What sort of soul

will this be? It must be the lowest surely, and this is the nutritive,

for this exists in all animals and plants alike. Why then does it

not perfect the parts and the animal? Because they must have a

sensitive soul, for the parts of animals are not like those of a

plant. And so the female animal needs the help of the male, for in

these animals we are speaking of the male is separate. This is exactly

what we find, for the wind-eggs become fertile if the male tread the

female in a certain space of time. About the cause of these things,

however, we shall enter into detail later.

  If there is any kind of animal which is female and has no male

separate from it, it is possible that this may generate a young one

from itself without copulation. No instance of this worthy of credit

has been observed up to the present at any rate, but one case in the

class of fishes makes us hesitate. No male of the so-called erythrinus

has ever yet been seen, but females, and specimens full of roe, have

been seen. Of this, however, we have as yet no proof worthy of credit.

Again, some members of the class of fishes are neither male nor

female, as eels and a kind of mullets found in stagnant waters. But

whenever the sexes are separate the female cannot generate perfectly

by herself alone, for then the male would exist in vain, and Nature

makes nothing in vain. Hence in such animals the male always

perfects the work of generation, for he imparts the sensitive soul,

either by means of the semen or without it. Now the parts of the

embryo already exist potentially in the material, and so when once the

principle of movement has been imparted to them they develop in a

chain one after another, as the wheels are moved one by another in the

automatic machines. When some of the natural philosophers say that

like is brought to like, this must be understood, not in the sense

that the parts are moved as changing place, but that they stay where

they are and the movement is a change of quality  (such as softness,

hardness, colour, and the other differences of the homogeneous parts);

 thus they become in actuality what they previously were in

potentiality. And what comes into being first is the first

principle; this is the heart in the sanguinea and its analogue in

the rest, as has been often said already. This is plain not only to

the senses  (that it is first to come into being),  but also in view

of its end; for life fails in the heart last of all, and it happens in

all cases that what comes into being last fails first, and the first

last, Nature running a double course, so to say, and turning back to

the point from whence she started. For the process of becoming is from

the non-existent to the existent, and that of perishing is back

again from the existent to the non-existent.

                                 6



  After this, as said already, the internal parts come into being

before the external. The greater become visible before the less,

even if some of them do not come into being before them. First the

parts above the hypozoma are differentiated and are superior in

size; the part below is both smaller and less differentiated. This

happens in all animals in which exists the distinction of upper and

lower, except in the insects; the growth of those that produce a

scolex is towards the upper part, for this is smaller in the

beginning. The cephalopoda are the only locomotive animals in which

the distinction of upper and lower does not exist.

  What has been said applies to plants also, that the upper portion is

earlier in development than the lower, for the roots push out from the

seed before the shoots.

  The agency by which the parts of animals are differentiated is

air, not however that of the mother nor yet of the embryo itself, as

some of the physicists say. This is manifest in birds, fishes, and

insects. For some of these are separated from the mother and

produced from an egg, within which the differentiation takes place;

other animals do not breathe at all, but are produced as a scolex or

an egg; those which do breathe and whose parts are differentiated

within the mother's uterus yet do not breathe until the lung is

perfected, and the lung and the preceding parts are differentiated

before they breathe. Moreover, all polydactylous quadrupeds, as dog,

lion, wolf, fox, jackal, produce their young blind, and the eyelids do

not separate till after birth. Manifestly the same holds also in all

the other parts; as the qualitative, so also the quantitative

differentia comes into being, pre-existing potentially but being

actualized later by the same causes by which the qualitative

distinction is produced, and so the eyelids become two instead of one.

Of course air must be present, because heat and moisture are

present, the former acting and the latter being acted upon.

  Some of the ancient nature-philosolphers made an attempt to state

which part comes into being after which, but were not sufficiently

acquainted with the facts. It is with the parts as with other

things; one naturally exists prior to another. But the word 'prior' is

used in more senses than one. For there is a difference between the

end or final cause and that which exists for the sake of it; the

latter is prior in order of development, the former is prior in

reality. Again, that which exists for the sake of the end admits of

division into two classes, (1) the origin of the movement, (2) that

which is used by the end; I mean, for instance, (1) that which can

generate, (2) that which serves as an instrument to what is generated,

for the one of these, that which makes, must exist first, as the

teacher before the learner, and the other later, as the pipes are

later than he who learns to play upon them, for it is superfluous that

men who do not know how to play should have pipes. Thus there are

three things: first, the end, by which we mean that for the sake of

which something else exists; secondly, the principle of movement and

of generation, existing for the sake of the end  (for that which can

make and generate, considered simply as such, exists only in

relation to what is made and generated);  thirdly, the useful, that is

to say what the end uses. Accordingly, there must first exist some

part in which is the principle of movement  (I say a part because this

is from the first one part of the end and the most important part

too);  next after this the whole and the end; thirdly and lastly,

the organic parts serving these for certain uses. Hence if there is

anything of this sort which must exist in animals, containing the

principle and end of all their nature, this must be the first to

come into being- first, that is, considered as the moving power, but

simultaneous with the whole embryo if considered as a part of the end.

Therefore all the organic parts whose nature is to bring others into

being must always themselves exist before them, for they are for the

sake of something else, as the beginning for the sake of the end;

all those parts which are for the sake of something else but are not

of the nature of beginnings must come into being later. So it is not

easy to distinguish which of the parts are prior, those which are

for the sake of another or that for the sake of which are the

former. For the parts which cause the movement, being prior to the end

in order of development, come in to cause confusion, and it is not

easy to distinguish these as compared with the organic parts. And

yet it is in accordance with this method that we must inquire what

comes into being after what; for the end is later than some parts

and earlier than others. And for this reason that part which

contains the first principle comes into being first, next to this

the upper half of the body. This is why the parts about the head,

and particularly the eyes, appear largest in the embryo at an early

stage, while the parts below the umbilicus, as the legs, are small;

for the lower parts are for the sake of the upper, and are neither

parts of the end nor able to form it.

  But they do not say well nor do they assign a necessary cause who

say simply that 'it always happens so', and imagine that this is a

first principle in these cases. Thus Democritus of Abdera says that

'there is no beginning of the infinite; now the cause is a

beginning, and the eternal is infinite; in consequence, to ask the

cause of anything of this kind is to seek for a beginning of the

infinite'. Yet according to this argument, which forbids us to seek

the cause, there will be no proof of any eternal truth whatever; but

we see that there is a proof of many such, whether by 'eternal' we

mean what always happens or what exists eternally; it is an eternal

truth that the angles of a triangle are always equal to two right

angles, or that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with the

side, and nevertheless a cause and a proof can be given for these

truths. While, then, it is well said that we must not take on us to

seek a beginning  (or first principle)  of all things, yet this is not

well said of all things whatever that always are or always happen, but

only of those which really are first principles of the eternal things;

for it is by another method, not by proof, that we acquire knowledge

of the first principle. Now in that which is immovable and

unchanging the first principle is simply the essence of the thing, but

when we come to those things which come into being the principles

are more than one, varying in kind and not all of the same kind; one

of this number is the principle of movement, and therefore in all

the sanguinea the heart is formed first, as was said at the beginning,

and in the other animals that which is analogous to the heart.

  From the heart the blood-vessels extend throughout the body as in

the anatomical diagrams which are represented on the wall, for the

parts lie round these because they are formed out of them. The

homogeneous parts are formed by heat and cold, for some are put

together and solidified by the one and some by the other. The

difference between these has already been discussed elsewhere, and

it has been stated what kinds of things are soluble by liquid and

fire, and what are not soluble by liquid and cannot be melted by fire.

The nutriment then oozes through the blood-vessels and the passages in

each of the parts, like water in unbaked pottery, and thus is formed

the flesh or its analogues, being solidified by cold, which is why

it is also dissolved by fire. But all the particles given off which

are too earthy, having but little moisture and heat, cool as the

moisture evaporates along with the heat; so they become hard and

earthy in character, as nails, horns, hoofs, and beaks, and

therefore they are softened by fire but none of them is melted by

it, while some of them, as egg-shells, are soluble in liquids. The

sinews and bones are formed by the internal heat as the moisture

dries, and hence the bones are insoluble by fire like pottery, for

like it they have been as it were baked in an oven by the heat in

the process of development. But it is not anything whatever that is

made into flesh or bone by the heat, but only something naturally

fitted for the purpose; nor is it made in any place or time

whatever, but only in a place and time naturally so fitted. For

neither will that which exists potentially be made except by that

moving agent which possesses the actuality, nor will that which

possesses the actuality make anything whatever; the carpenter would

not make a box except out of wood, nor will a box be made out of the

wood without the carpenter. The heat exists in the seminal

secretion, and the movement and activity in it is sufficient in kind

and in quantity to correspond to each of the parts. In so far as there

is any deficiency or excess, the resulting product is in worse

condition or physically defective, in like manner as in the case of

external substances which are thickened by boiling that they may be

more palatable or for any other purpose. But in the latter case it

is we who apply the heat in due measure for the motion required; in

the former it is the nature of the male parent that gives it, or

with animals spontaneously generated it is the movement and heat

imparted by the right season of the year that it is the cause.

  Cooling, again, is mere deprivation of heat. Nature makes use of

both; they have of necessity the power of bringing about different

results, but in the development of the embryo we find that the one

cools and the other heats for some definite purpose, and so each of

the parts is formed; thus it is in one sense by necessity, in

another for a final cause, that they make the flesh soft, the sinews

solid and elastic, the bones solid and brittle. The skin, again, is

formed by the drying of the flesh, like the scum upon boiled

substances; it is so formed not only because it is on the outside, but

also because what is glutinous, being unable to evaporate, remains

on the surface. While in other animals the glutinous is dry, for which

reason the covering of the invertebrates is testaceous or crustaceous,

in the vertebrates it is rather of the nature of fat. In all of

these which are not of too earthy a nature the fat is collected

under the covering of the skin, a fact which points to the skin

being formed out of such a glutinous substance, for fat is somewhat

glutinous. As we said, all these things must be understood to be

formed in one sense of necessity, but in another sense not of

necessity but for a final cause.

  The upper half of the body, then, is first marked out in the order

of development; as time goes on the lower also reaches its full size

in the sanguinea. All the parts are first marked out in their outlines

and acquire later on their colour and softness or hardness, exactly as

if Nature were a painter producing a work of art, for painters, too,

first sketch in the animal with lines and only after that put in the

colours.

  Because the source of the sensations is in the heart, therefore this

is the part first formed in the whole animal, and because of the

heat of this organ the cold forms the brain, where the blood-vessels

terminate above, corresponding to the heat of the heart. Hence the

parts about the head begin to form next in order after the heart,

and surpass the other parts in size, for the brain is from the first

large and fluid.

  There is a difficulty about what happens with the eyes of animals.

Though from the beginning they appear very large in all creatures,

whether they walk or swim or fly, yet they are the last of the parts

to be formed completely, for in the intervening time they collapse.

The reason is this. The sense-organ of the eyes is set upon certain

passages, as are the other sense-organs. Whereas those of touch and

taste are simply the body itself or some part of the body of

animals, those of smell and hearing are passages connecting with the

external air and full themselves of innate spiritus; these passages

end at the small blood-vessels about the brain which run thither

from the heart. But the eye is the only sense-organ that has a

bodily constitution peculiar to itself. It is fluid and cold, and does

not exist from the first in the place which it occupies later in the

same way as the other parts do, for they exist potentially to begin

with and actually come into being later, but the eye is the purest

part of the liquidity about the brain drained off through the passages

which are visible running from them to the membrane round the brain. A

proof of this is that, apart from the brain, there is no other part in

the head that is cold and fluid except the eye. Of necessity therefore

this region is large at first but falls in later. For the same thing

happens with the brain; at first it is liquid and large, but in course

of evaporation and concoction it becomes more solid and falls in; this

applies both to the brain and the eyes. The head is very large at

first, on account of the brain, and the eyes appear large because of

the liquid in them. They are the last organs to reach completion

because the brain is formed with difficulty; for it is at a late

period that it gets rid of its coldness and fluidity; this applies

to all animals possessing a brain, but especially to man. For this

reason the 'bregma' is the last of the bones to be formed; even

after birth this bone is still soft in children. The cause of this

being so with men more than with other animals is the fact that

their brain is the most fluid and largest. This again is because the

heat in man's heart is purest. His intellect shows how well he is

tempered, for man is the wisest of animals. And children for a long

time have no control over their heads on account of the heaviness of

the brain; and the same applies to the parts which it is necessary

to move, for it is late that the principle of motion gets control over

the upper parts, and last of all over those whose motion is not

connected directly with it, as that of the legs is not. Now the eyelid

is such a part. But since Nature makes nothing superfluous nor in

vain, it is clear also that she makes nothing too late or too soon,

for if she did the result would be either in vain or superfluous.

Hence it is necessary that the eyelids should be separated at the same

time as the heart is able to move them. So then the eyes of animals

are perfected late because of the amount of concoction required by the

brain, and last of all the parts because the motion must be very

strong before it can affect parts so far from the first principle of

motion and so cold. And it is plain that such is the nature of the

eyelids, for if the head is affected by never so little heaviness

through sleepiness or drunkenness or anything else of the kind, we

cannot raise the eyelids though their own weight is so small. So

much for the question how the eyes come into being, and why and for

what cause they are the last to be fully developed.

  Each of the other parts is formed out of the nutriment, those most

honourable and participating in the sovereign principle from the

nutriment which is first and purest and fully concocted, those which

are only necessary for the sake of the former parts from the

inferior nutriment and the residues left over from the other. For

Nature, like a good householder, is not in the habit of throwing

away anything from which it is possible to make anything useful. Now

in a household the best part of the food that comes in is set apart

for the free men, the inferior and the residue of the best for the

slaves, and the worst is given to the animals that live with them.

Just as the intellect acts thus in the outside world with a view to

the growth of the persons concerned, so in the case of the embryo

itself does Nature form from the purest material the flesh and the

body of the other sense-organs, and from the residues thereof bones,

sinews, hair, and also nails and hoofs and the like; hence these are

last to assume their form, for they have to wait till the time when

Nature has some residue to spare.

  The bones, then, are made in the first conformation of the parts

from the seminal secretion or residue. As the animal grows the bones

grow from the natural nourishment, being the same as that of the

sovereign parts, but of this they only take up the superfluous

residues. For everywhere the nutriment may be divided into two

kinds, the first and the second; the former is 'nutritious', being

that which gives its essence both to the whole and to the parts; the

latter is concerned with growth, being that which causes

quantitative increase. But these must be distinguished more fully

later on. The sinews are formed in the same way as the bones and out

of the same materials, the Seminal and nutritious residue. Nails,

hair, hoofs, horns, beaks, the spurs of cocks, and any other similar

parts, are on the contrary formed from the nutriment which is taken

later and only concerned with growth, in other words that which is

derived from the mother, or from the outer world after birth. For this

reason the bones on the one hand only grow up to a certain point  (for

there is a limit of size in all animals, and therefore also of the

growth of the bones; if these had been always able to grow, all

animals that have bone or its analogue would grow as long as they

lived, for these set the limit of size to animals. What is the

reason of their not always increasing in size must be stated later.)

 Hair, on the contrary, and growths akin to hair go on growing as long

as they exist at all, and increase yet more in diseases and when the

body is getting old and wasting, because more residual matter is

left over, as owing to old age and disease less is expended on the

important parts, though when the residual matter also fails through

age the hair fails with it. But the contrary is the case with the

bones, for they waste away along with the body and the other parts.

Hair actually goes on growing after death; it does not, however, begin

growing then.

  About the teeth a difficulty may be raised. They have actually the

same nature as the bones, and are formed out of the bones, but

nails, hair, horns, and the like are formed out of the skin, and

that is why they change in colour along with it, for they become

white, black, and all sorts of colours according to that of the

skin. But the teeth do nothing of the sort, for they are made out of

the bones in all animals that have both bones and teeth. Of all the

bones they alone go on growing through life, as is plain with the

teeth which grow out of the straight line so as no longer to touch

each other. The reason for their growth, as a final cause, is their

function, for they would soon be worn down if there were not some

means of saving them; even as it is they are altogether worn down in

old age in some animals which eat much and have not large teeth, their

growth not being in proportion to their detrition. And so Nature has

contrived well to meet the case in this also, for she causes the

failure of the teeth to synchronize with old age and death. If life

lasted for a thousand or ten thousand years the original teeth must

have been very large indeed, and many sets of them must have been

produced, for even if they had grown continuously they would still

have been worn smooth and become useless for their work. The final

cause of their growth has been now stated, but besides this as a

matter of fact the growth of the teeth is not the same as that of

the other bones. The latter all come into being in the first formation

of the embryo and none of them later, but the teeth do so later.

Therefore it is possible for them to grow again after the first set

falls out, for though they touch the bones they are not connate with

them. They are formed, however, out of the nutriment distributed to

the bones, and so have the same nature, even when the bones have their

own number complete.

  Other animals are born in possession of teeth or their analogue

(unless in cases contrary to Nature),  because when they are set

free from the parent they are more perfect than man; but man  (also

unless in cases contrary to Nature)  is born without them.

  The reason will be stated later why some teeth are formed and fall

out but others do not fall out.

  It is because such parts are formed from a residue that man is the

most naked in body of all animals and has the smallest nails in

proportion to his size; he has the least amount of earthy residue, but

that part of the blood which is not concocted is the residue, and

the earthy part in the bodies of all animals is the least concocted.

We have now stated how each of the parts is formed and what is the

cause of their generation.

                                 7



  In viviparous animals, as said before, the embryo gets its growth

through the umbilical cord. For since the nutritive power of the soul,

as well as the others, is present in animals, it straightway sends off

this cord like a root to the uterus. The cord consists of

blood-vessels in a sheath, more numerous in the larger animals as

cattle and the like, one in the smallest, two in those of intermediate

size. Through this cord the embryo receives its nourishment in the

form of blood, for the uterus is the termination of many

blood-vessels. All animals with no front teeth in the upper jaw, and

all those which have them in both jaws and whose uterus has not one

great blood-vessel running through it but many close together instead-

all these have in the uterus the so-called cotyledons  (with which the

umbilical cord connects and is closely united; for the vessels which

pass through the cord run backwards and forwards between embryo and

uterus and split up into smaller vessels all over the uterus; where

they terminate, there are found the cotyledons).  Their convexity is

turned towards the uterus, the concavity towards the embryo. Between

uterus and embryo are the chorion and the membranes. As the embryo

grows and approaches perfection the cotyledons become smaller and

finally disappear when it is perfected. For Nature sends the

sanguineous nutriment for the embryo into this part of the uterus as

she sends milk into the breasts, and because the cotyledons are

gradually aggregated from many into a few the body of the cotyledon

becomes like an eruption or inflammation. So long as the embryo is

comparatively small, being unable to receive much nutriment, they

are plain and large, but when it has increased in size they fall in

together.

  But most of the animals which have front teeth in both jaws and no

horns have no cotyledons in the uterus, but the umbilical cord runs to

meet one blood-vessel, which is large and extends throughout the

uterus. Of such animals some produce one young at a time, some more

than one, but the same description applies to both these classes.

(This should be studied with the aid of the examples drawn in the

Anatomy and the Enquiries.)  For the young, if numerous, are

attached each to its umbilical cord, and this to the blood-vessel of

the mother; they are arranged next to one another along the stream

of the blood-vessel as along a canal; and each embryo is enclosed in

its membranes and chorion.

  Those who say that children are nourished in the uterus by sucking

some lump of flesh or other are mistaken. If so, the same would have

been the case with other animals, but as it is we do not find this

(and this can easily be observed by dissection).  Secondly, all

embryos alike, whether of creatures that fly or swim or walk, are

surrounded by fine membranes separating them from the uterus and

from the fluids which are formed in it; but neither in these

themselves is there anything of the kind, nor is it possible for the

embryo to take nourishment by means of any of them. Thirdly, it is

plain that all creatures developed in eggs grow when separated from

the uterus.

  Natural intercourse takes place between animals of the same kind.

However, those also unite whose nature is near akin and whose form

is not very different, if their size is much the same and if the

periods of gestation are equal. In other animals such cases are

rare, but they occur with dogs and foxes and wolves; the Indian dogs

also spring from the union of a dog with some wild dog-like animal.

A similar thing has been seen to take place in those birds that are

amative, as partridges and hens. Among birds of prey hawks of

different form are thought to unite, and the same applies to some

other birds. Nothing worth mentioning has been observed in the

inhabitants of the sea, but the so-called 'rhinobates' especially is

thought to spring from the union of the 'rhini' and 'batus'. And the

proverb about Libya, that 'Libya is always producing something new',

is said to have originated from animals of different species uniting

with one another in that country, for it is said that because of the

want of water all meet at the few places where springs are to be

found, and that even different kinds unite in consequence.

  Of the animals that arise from such union all except mules are found

to copulate again with each other and to be able to produce young of

both sexes, but mules alone are sterile, for they do not generate by

union with one another or with other animals. The problem why any

individual, whether male or female, is sterile is a general one, for

some men and women are sterile, and so are other animals in their

several kinds, as horses and sheep. But this kind, of mules, is

universally so. The causes of sterility in other animals are

several. Both men and women are sterile from birth when the parts

useful for union are imperfect, so that men never grow a beard but

remain like eunuchs, and women do not attain puberty; the same thing

may befall others as their years advance, sometimes on account of

the body being too well nourished  (for men who are in too good

condition and women who are too fat the seminal secretion is taken

up into the body, and the former have no semen, the latter no

catamenia);  at other times by reason of sickness men emit the semen

in a cold and liquid state, and the discharges of women are bad and

full of morbid secretions. Often, too, in both sexes this state is

caused by injuries in the parts and regions contributory to

copulation. Some such cases are curable, others incurable, but the

subjects especially remain sterile if anything of the sort has

happened in the first formation of the parts in the embryo, for then

are produced women of a masculine and men of a feminine appearance,

and in the former the catamenia do not occur, in the latter the

semen is thin and cold. Hence it is with good reason that the semen of

men is tested in water to find out if it is infertile, for that

which is thin and cold is quickly spread out on the surface, but the

fertile sinks to the bottom, for that which is well concocted is hot

indeed, but that which is firm and thick is well concocted. They

test women by pessaries to see if the smells thereof permeate from

below upwards to the breath from the mouth and by colours smeared upon

the eyes to see if they colour the saliva. If these results do not

follow it is a sign that the passages of the body, through which the

catamenia are secreted, are clogged and closed. For the region about

the eyes is, of all the head, that most nearly connected with the

generative secretions; a proof of this is that it alone is visibly

changed in sexual intercourse, and those who indulge too much in

this are seen to have their eyes sunken in. The reason is that the

nature of the semen is similar to that of the brain, for the

material of it is watery  (the heat being acquired later).  And the

seminal purgations are from the region of the diaphragm, for the first

principle of nature is there, so that the movements from the pudenda

are communicated to the chest, and the smells from the chest are

perceived through the respiration.

                                 8



  In men, then, and in other kinds, as said before, such deficiency

occurs sporadically, but the whole of the mule kind is sterile. The

reason has not been rightly given by Empedocles and Democritus, of

whom the former expresses himself obscurely, the latter more

intelligibly. For they offer their demonstration in the case of all

these animals alike which unite against their affinities. Democritus

says that the genital passages of mules are spoilt in the mother's

uterus because the animals from the first are not produced from

parents of the same kind. But we find that though this is so with

other animals they are none the less able to generate; yet, if this

were the reason, all others that unite in this manner ought to be

barren. Empedocles assigns as his reason that the mixture of the

'seeds' becomes dense, each of the two seminal fluids out of which

it is made being soft, for the hollows in each fit into the

densities of the other, and in such cases a hard substance is formed

out of soft ones, like bronze mingled with tin. Now he does not give

the correct reason in the case of bronze and tin- (we have spoken of

them in the Problems)- nor, to take general ground, does he take his

principles from the intelligible. How do the 'hollows' and 'solids'

fit into one another to make the mixing, e.g. in the case of wine

and water? This saying is quite beyond us; for how we are to

understand the 'hollows' of the wine and water is too far beyond our

perception. Again, when, as a matter of fact, horse is born of

horse, ass of ass, and mule of horse and ass in two ways according

as the parents are stallion and she-ass or jackass and mare, why in

the last case does there result something so 'dense' that the

offspring is sterile, whereas the offspring of male and female

horse, male and female ass, is not sterile? And yet the generative

fluid of the male and female horse is soft. But both sexes of the

horse cross with both sexes of the ass, and the offspring of both

crosses are barren, according to Empedocles, because from both is

produced something 'dense', the 'seeds' being 'soft'. If so, the

offspring of stallion and mare ought also to be sterile. If one of

them alone united with the ass, it might be said that the cause of the

mule's being unable to generate was the unlikeness of that one to

the generative fluid of the ass; but, as it is, whatever be the

character of that generative fluid with which it unites in the ass,

such it is also in the animal of its own kind. Then, again, the

argument is intended to apply to both male and female mules alike, but

the male does generate at seven years of age, it is said; it is the

female alone that is entirely sterile, and even she is so only because

she does not complete the development of the embryo, for a female mule

has been known to conceive.

  Perhaps an abstract proof might appear to be more plausible than

those already given; I call it abstract because the more general it is

the further is it removed from the special principles involved. It

runs somewhat as follows. From male and female of the same species

there are born in course of nature male and female of the same species

as the parents, e.g. male and female puppies from male and female dog.

From parents of different species is born a young one different in

species; thus if a dog is different from a lion, the offspring of male

dog and lioness or of lion and bitch will be different from both

parents. If this is so, then since (1) mules are produced of both

sexes and are not different in species from one another, and (2) a

mule is born of horse and ass and these are different in species

from mules, it is impossible that anything should be produced from

mules. For (1) another kind cannot be, because the product of male and

female of the same species is also of the same species, and (2) a mule

cannot be, because that is the product of horse and ass which are

different in form,  [and it was laid down that from parents

different in form is born a different animal].  Now this theory is too

general and empty. For all theories not based on the special

principles involved are empty; they only appear to be connected with

the facts without being so really. As geometrical arguments must start

from geometrical principles, so it is with the others; that which is

empty may seem to be something, but is really nothing. Now the basis

of this particular theory is not true, for many animals of different

species are fertile with one another, as was said before. So we must

not inquire into questions of natural science in this fashion any more

than any other questions; we shall be more likely to find the reason

by considering the facts peculiar to the two kinds concerned, horse

and ass. In the first place, each of them, if mated with its own kind,

bears only one young one; secondly, the females are not always able to

conceive from the male  (wherefore breeders put the horse to the

mare again at intervals).  Indeed, both the mare is deficient in

catamenia, discharging less than any other quadruped, and the

she-ass does not admit the impregnation, but ejects the semen with her

urine, wherefore men follow flogging her after intercourse. Again

the ass is an animal of cold nature, and so is not wont to be produced

in wintry regions because it cannot bear cold, as in Scythia and the

neighbouring country and among the Celts beyond Iberia, for this

country also is cold. For this cause they do not put the jackasses

to the females at the equinox, as they do with horses, but about the

summer solstice, in order that the ass-foals may be born in a warm

season, for the mothers bear at the same season as that in which

they are impregnated, the period of gestation in both horse and ass

being one year. The animal, then, being, as has been said of such a

cold nature, its semen also must be cold. A proof of this is that if a

horse mount a female already impregnated by an ass he does not destroy

the impregnation of the ass, but if the ass be the second to mount her

he does destroy that of the horse because of the coldness of his own

semen. When, therefore, they unite with each other, the generative

elements are preserved by the heat of the one of them, that

contributed by the horse being the hotter; for in the ass both the

semen of the male and the material contributed by the female are cold,

and those of the horse, in both sexes, are hotter. Now when either hot

is added to cold or cold to hot so as to mix, the result is that the

embryo itself arising from these is preserved and thus these animals

are fertile when crossed with one another, but the animal produced

by them is no longer fertile but unable to produce perfect offspring.

  And in general each of these animals naturally tends towards

sterility. The ass has all the disadvantages already mentioned, and if

it should not begin to generate after the first shedding of teeth,

it no longer generates at all; so near is the constitution of the

ass to being sterile. The horse is much the same; it tends naturally

towards sterility, and to make it entirely so it is only necessary

that its generative secretion should become colder; now this is what

happens to it when mixed with the corresponding secretion of the

ass. The ass in like manner comes very near generating a sterile

animal when mated with its own species. Thus when the difficulty of

a cross contrary to nature is added,  (when too even in the other case

when united with their own species they with difficulty produce a

single young one),  the result of the cross, being still more

sterile and contrary to nature, will need nothing further to make it

sterile, but will be so of necessity.

  We find also that the bodies of female mules grow large because

the matter which is secreted in other animals to form the catamenia is

diverted to growth. But since the period of gestation in such

animals is a year, the mule must not only conceive, if she is to be

fertile, but must also nourish the embryo till birth, and this is

impossible if there are no catamenia. But there are none in the

mule; the useless part of the nutriment is discharged with the

excretion from the bladder- this is why male mules do not smell to the

pudenda of the females, as do the other solid-hoofed ungulates, but

only to the evacuation itself- and the rest of the nutriment is used

up to increase the size of the body. Hence it is sometimes possible

for the female to conceive, as has been known to happen before now,

but it is impossible for her to complete the process of nourishing the

embryo and bringing it to birth.

  The male, again, may sometimes generate, both because the male sex

is naturally hotter than the female and because it does not contribute

any material substance to the mixture. The result in such cases is a

'ginnus', that is to say, a dwarf mule; for 'ginni' are produced

also from the crossing of horse and ass when the embryo is diseased in

the uterus. The ginnus is in fact like the so-called 'metachoera' in

swine, for a 'metachoerum' also is a pig injured in the uterus; this

may happen to any pig. The origin of human dwarfs is similar, for

these also have their parts and their whole development injured during

gestation, and resemble ginni and metachoera.
