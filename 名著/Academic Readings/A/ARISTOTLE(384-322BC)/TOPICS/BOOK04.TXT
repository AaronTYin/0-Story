  NEXT we must go on to examine questions relating to Genus and

Property. These are elements in the questions that relate to

definitions, but dialecticians seldom address their inquiries to these

by themselves. If, then, a genus be suggested for something that is,

first take a look at all objects which belong to the same genus as the

thing mentioned, and see whether the genus suggested is not predicated

of one of them, as happens in the case of an accident: e.g. if

'good' be laid down to be the genus of 'pleasure', see whether some

particular pleasure be not good: for, if so, clearly good' is not

the genus of pleasure: for the genus is predicated of all the

members of the same species. Secondly, see whether it be predicated

not in the category of essence, but as an accident, as 'white' is

predicated of 'snow', or 'self-moved' of the soul. For 'snow' is not a

kind of 'white', and therefore 'white' is not the genus of snow, nor

is the soul a kind of 'moving object': its motion is an accident of

it, as it often is of an animal to walk or to be walking. Moreover,

'moving' does not seem to indicate the essence, but rather a state

of doing or of having something done to it. Likewise, also, 'white':

for it indicates not the essence of snow, but a certain quality of it.

So that neither of them is predicated in the category of 'essence'.

  Especially you should take a look at the definition of Accident, and

see whether it fits the genus mentioned, as (e.g.) is also the case in

the instances just given. For it is possible for a thing to be and not

to be self-moved, and likewise, also, for it to be and not to be

white. So that neither of these attributes is the genus but an

accident, since we were saying that an accident is an attribute

which can belong to a thing and also not belong.

  Moreover, see whether the genus and the species be not found in

the same division, but the one be a substance while the other is a

quality, or the one be a relative while the other is a quality, as

(e.g.) 'slow' and 'swan' are each a substance, while 'white' is not

a substance but a quality, so that 'white' is not the genus either

of 'snow' or of 'swan'. Again, knowledge' is a relative, while

'good' and 'noble' are each a quality, so that good, or noble, is

not the genus of knowledge. For the genera of relatives ought

themselves also to be relatives, as is the case with 'double': for

multiple', which is the genus of 'double', is itself also a

relative. To speak generally, the genus ought to fall under the same

division as the species: for if the species be a substance, so too

should be the genus, and if the species be a quality, so too the genus

should be a quality; e.g. if white be a quality, so too should

colour be. Likewise, also, in other cases.

  Again, see whether it be necessary or possible for the genus to

partake of the object which has been placed in the genus. 'To partake'

is defined as 'to admit the definition of that which is partaken.

Clearly, therefore, the species partake of the genera, but not the

genera of the species: for the species admits the definition of the

genus, whereas the genus does not admit that of the species. You

must look, therefore, and see whether the genus rendered partakes or

can possibly partake of the species, e.g. if any one were to render

anything as genus of 'being' or of 'unity': for then the result will

be that the genus partakes of the species: for of everything that

is, 'being' and 'unity' are predicated, and therefore their definition

as well.

  Moreover, see if there be anything of which the species rendered

is true, while the genus is not so, e.g. supposing 'being' or

'object of knowledge' were stated to be the genus of 'object of

opinion'. For 'object of opinion' will be a predicate of what does not

exist; for many things which do not exist are objects of opinion;

whereas that 'being' or 'object of knowledge' is not predicated of

what does not exist is clear. So that neither 'being' nor 'object of

knowledge' is the genus of 'object of opinion': for of the objects

of which the species is predicated, the genus ought to be predicated

as well.

  Again, see whether the object placed in the genus be quite unable to

partake of any of its species: for it is impossible that it should

partake of the genus if it do not partake of any of its species,

except it be one of the species reached by the first division: these

do partake of the genus alone. If, therefore, 'Motion' be stated as

the genus of pleasure, you should look and see if pleasure be

neither locomotion nor alteration, nor any of the rest of the given

modes of motion: for clearly you may then take it that it does not

partake of any of the species, and therefore not of the genus

either, since what partakes of the genus must necessarily partake of

one of the species as well: so that pleasure could not be a species of

Motion, nor yet be one of the individual phenomena comprised under the

term 'motion'. For individuals as well partake in the genus and the

species, as (e.g.) an individual man partakes of both 'man' and

'animal'.

  Moreover, see if the term placed in the genus has a wider denotation

than the genus, as (e.g.) 'object of opinion' has, as compared with

'being': for both what is and what is not are objects of opinion, so

that 'object of opinion' could not be a species of being: for the

genus is always of wider denotation than the species. Again, see if

the species and its genus have an equal denotation; suppose, for

instance, that of the attributes which go with everything, one were to

be stated as a species and the other as its genus, as for example

Being and Unity: for everything has being and unity, so that neither

is the genus of the other, since their denotation is equal.

Likewise, also, if the 'first' of a series and the 'beginning' were to

be placed one under the other: for the beginning is first and the

first is the beginning, so that either both expressions are

identical or at any rate neither is the genus of the other. The

elementary principle in regard to all such cases is that the genus has

a wider denotation than the species and its differentia: for the

differentia as well has a narrower denotation than the genus.

  See also whether the genus mentioned fails, or might be generally

thought to fail, to apply to some object which is not specifically

different from the thing in question; or, if your argument be

constructive, whether it does so apply. For all things that are not

specifically different have the same genus. If, therefore, it be shown

to apply to one, then clearly it applies to all, and if it fails to

apply to one, clearly it fails to apply to any; e.g. if any one who

assumes 'indivisible lines' were to say that the 'indivisible' is

their genus. For the aforesaid term is not the genus of divisible

lines, and these do not differ as regards their species from

indivisible: for straight lines are never different from each other as

regards their species.



                                 2



  Look and see, also, if there be any other genus of the given species

which neither embraces the genus rendered nor yet falls under it, e.g.

suppose any one were to lay down that 'knowledge' is the genus of

justice. For virtue is its genus as well, and neither of these

genera embraces the remaining one, so that knowledge could not be

the genus of justice: for it is generally accepted that whenever one

species falls under two genera, the one is embraced by the other.

Yet a principle of this kind gives rise to a difficulty in some cases.

For some people hold that prudence is both virtue and knowledge, and

that neither of its genera is embraced by the other: although

certainly not everybody admits that prudence is knowledge. If,

however, any one were to admit the truth of this assertion, yet it

would still be generally agreed to be necessary that the genera of the

same object must at any rate be subordinate either the one to the

other or both to the same, as actually is the case with virtue and

knowledge. For both fall under the same genus; for each of them is a

state and a disposition. You should look, therefore, and see whether

neither of these things is true of the genus rendered; for if the

genera be subordinate neither the one to the other nor both to the

same, then what is rendered could not be the true genus.

  Look, also, at the genus of the genus rendered, and so continually

at the next higher genus, and see whether all are predicated of the

species, and predicated in the category of essence: for all the higher

genera should be predicated of the species in the category of essence.

If, then, there be anywhere a discrepancy, clearly what is rendered is

not the true genus. [Again, see whether either the genus itself, or

one of its higher genera, partakes of the species: for the higher

genus does not partake of any of the lower.] If, then, you are

overthrowing a view, follow the rule as given: if establishing one,

then-suppose that what has been named as genus be admitted to belong

to the species, only it be disputed whether it belongs as genus-it

is enough to show that one of its higher genera is predicated of the

species in the category of essence. For if one of them be predicated

in the category of essence, all of them, both higher and lower than

this one, if predicated at all of the species, will be predicated of

it in the category of essence: so that what has been rendered as genus

is also predicated in the category of essence. The premiss that when

one genus is predicated in the category of essence, all the rest, if

predicated at all, will be predicated in the category of essence,

should be secured by induction. Supposing, however, that it be

disputed whether what has been rendered as genus belongs at all, it is

not enough to show that one of the higher genera is predicated of

the species in the category of essence: e.g. if any one has rendered

'locomotion' as the genus of walking, it is not enough to show that

walking is 'motion' in order to show that it is 'locomotion', seeing

that there are other forms of motion as well; but one must show in

addition that walking does not partake of any of the species of motion

produced by the same division except locomotion. For of necessity what

partakes of the genus partakes also of one of the species produced

by the first division of the genus. If, therefore, walking does not

partake either of increase or decrease or of the other kinds of

motion, clearly it would partake of locomotion, so that locomotion

would be the genus of walking.

  Again, look among the things of which the given species is

predicated as genus, and see if what is rendered as its genus be

also predicated in the category of essence of the very things of which

the species is so predicated, and likewise if all the genera higher

than this genus are so predicated as well. For if there be anywhere

a discrepancy, clearly what has been rendered is not the true genus:

for had it been the genus, then both the genera higher than it, and it

itself, would all have been predicated in the category of essence of

those objects of which the species too is predicated in the category

of essence. If, then, you are overthrowing a view, it is useful to see

whether the genus fails to be predicated in the category of essence of

those things of which the species too is predicated. If establishing a

view, it is useful to see whether it is predicated in the category

of essence: for if so, the result will be that the genus and the

species will be predicated of the same object in the category of

essence, so that the same object falls under two genera: the genera

must therefore of necessity be subordinate one to the other, and

therefore if it be shown that the one we wish to establish as genus is

not subordinate to the species, clearly the species would be

subordinate to it, so that you may take it as shown that it is the

genus.

  Look, also, at the definitions of the genera, and see whether they

apply both to the given species and to the objects which partake of

the species. For of necessity the definitions of its genera must be

predicated of the species and of the objects which partake of the

species: if, then, there be anywhere a discrepancy, clearly what has

been rendered is not the genus.

  Again, see if he has rendered the differentia as the genus, e.g.

'immortal' as the genus of 'God'. For 'immortal' is a differentia of

'living being', seeing that of living beings some are mortal and

others immortal. Clearly, then, a bad mistake has been made; for the

differentia of a thing is never its genus. And that this is true is

clear: for a thing's differentia never signifies its essence, but

rather some quality, as do 'walking' and 'biped'.

  Also, see whether he has placed the differentia inside the genus,

e.g. by taking 'odd' as a number'. For 'odd' is a differentia of

number, not a species. Nor is the differentia generally thought to

partake of the genus: for what partakes of the genus is always

either a species or an individual, whereas the differentia is

neither a species nor an individual. Clearly, therefore, the

differentia does not partake of the genus, so that 'odd' too is no

species but a differentia, seeing that it does not partake of the

genus.

  Moreover, see whether he has placed the genus inside the species,

e.g. by taking 'contact' to be a 'juncture', or 'mixture' a

'fusion', or, as in Plato's definition,' 'locomotion' to be the same

as 'carriage'. For there is no necessity that contact should be

juncture: rather, conversely, juncture must be contact: for what is in

contact is not always joined, though what is joined is always in

contact. Likewise, also, in the remaining instances: for mixture is

not always a 'fusion' (for to mix dry things does not fuse them),

nor is locomotion always 'carriage'. For walking is not generally

thought to be carriage: for 'carriage' is mostly used of things that

change one place for another involuntarily, as happens in the case

of inanimate things. Clearly, also, the species, in the instances

given, has a wider denotation than the genus, whereas it ought to be

vice versa.

 Again, see whether he has placed the differentia inside the

species, by taking (e.g.) 'immortal' to be 'a god'. For the result

will be that the species has an equal or wider denotation: and this

cannot be, for always the differentia has an equal or a wider

denotation than the species. Moreover, see whether he has placed the

genus inside the differentia, by making 'colour' (e.g.) to be a

thing that 'pierces', or 'number' a thing that is 'odd'. Also, see

if he has mentioned the genus as differentia: for it is possible for a

man to bring forward a statement of this kind as well, e.g. that

'mixture' is the differentia of 'fusion', or that change of place'

is the differentia of 'carriage'. All such cases should be examined by

means of the same principles: for they depend upon common rules: for

the genus should have a wider denotation that its differentia, and

also should not partake of its differentia; whereas, if it be rendered

in this manner, neither of the aforesaid requirements can be

satisfied: for the genus will both have a narrower denotation than its

differentia, and will partake of it.

  Again, if no differentia belonging to the genus be predicated of the

given species, neither will the genus be predicated of it; e.g. of

'soul' neither 'odd' nor 'even' is predicated: neither therefore is

'number'. Moreover, see whether the species is naturally prior and

abolishes the genus along with itself: for the contrary is the general

view. Moreover, if it be possible for the genus stated, or for its

differentia, to be absent from the alleged species, e.g. for

'movement' to be absent from the 'soul', or 'truth and falsehood' from

'opinion', then neither of the terms stated could be its genus or

its differentia: for the general view is that the genus and the

differentia accompany the species, as long as it exists.



                                 3



  Look and see, also, if what is placed in the genus partakes or could

possibly partake of any contrary of the genus: for in that case the

same thing will at the same time partake of contrary things, seeing

that the genus is never absent from it, while it partakes, or can

possibly partake, of the contrary genus as well. Moreover, see whether

the species shares in any character which it is utterly impossible for

any member of the genus to have. Thus (e.g.) if the soul has a share

in life, while it is impossible for any number to live, then the

soul could not be a species of number.

  You should look and see, also, if the species be a homonym of the

genus, and employ as your elementary principles those already stated

for dealing with homonymity: for the genus and the species are

synonymous.

  Seeing that of every genus there is more than one species, look

and see if it be impossible that there should be another species

than the given one belonging to the genus stated: for if there

should be none, then clearly what has been stated could not be a genus

at all.

  Look and see, also, if he has rendered as genus a metaphorical

expression, describing (e.g. 'temperance' as a 'harmony': a 'harmony':

for a genus is always predicated of its species in its literal

sense, whereas 'harmony' is predicated of temperance not in a

literal sense but metaphorically: for a harmony always consists in

notes.

  Moreover, if there be any contrary of the species, examine it. The

examination may take different forms; first of all see if the contrary

as well be found in the same genus as the species, supposing the genus

to have no contrary; for contraries ought to be found in the same

genus, if there be no contrary to the genus. Supposing, on the other

hand, that there is a contrary to the genus, see if the contrary of

the species be found in the contrary genus: for of necessity the

contrary species must be in the contrary genus, if there be any

contrary to the genus. Each of these points is made plain by means

of induction. Again, see whether the contrary of the species be not

found in any genus at all, but be itself a genus, e.g. 'good': for

if this be not found in any genus, neither will its contrary be

found in any genus, but will itself be a genus, as happens in the case

of 'good' and 'evil': for neither of these is found in a genus, but

each of them is a genus. Moreover, see if both genus and species be

contrary to something, and one pair of contraries have an

intermediary, but not the other. For if the genera have an

intermediary, so should their species as well, and if the species

have, so should their genera as well, as is the case with (1) virtue

and vice and (2) justice and injustice: for each pair has an

intermediary. An objection to this is that there is no intermediary

between health and disease, although there is one between evil and

good. Or see whether, though there be indeed an intermediary between

both pairs, i.e. both between the species and between the genera,

yet it be not similarly related, but in one case be a mere negation of

the extremes, whereas in the other case it is a subject. For the

general view is that the relation should be similar in both cases,

as it is in the cases of virtue and vice and of justice and injustice:

for the intermediaries between both are mere negations. Moreover,

whenever the genus has no contrary, look and see not merely whether

the contrary of the species be found in the same genus, but the

intermediate as well: for the genus containing the extremes contains

the intermediates as well, as (e.g.) in the case of white and black:

for 'colour' is the genus both of these and of all the intermediate

colours as well. An objection may be raised that 'defect' and 'excess'

are found in the same genus (for both are in the genus 'evil'),

whereas moderate amount', the intermediate between them, is found

not in 'evil' but in 'good'. Look and see also whether, while the

genus has a contrary, the species has none; for if the genus be

contrary to anything, so too is the species, as virtue to vice and

justice to injustice.

  Likewise. also, if one were to look at other instances, one would

come to see clearly a fact like this. An objection may be raised in

the case of health and disease: for health in general is the

contrary of disease, whereas a particular disease, being a species

of disease, e.g. fever and ophthalmia and any other particular

disease, has no contrary.

  If, therefore, you are demolishing a view, there are all these

ways in which you should make your examination: for if the aforesaid

characters do not belong to it, clearly what has been rendered is

not the genus. If, on the other hand, you are establishing a view,

there are three ways: in the first place, see whether the contrary

of the species be found in the genus stated, suppose the genus have no

contrary: for if the contrary be found in it, clearly the species in

question is found in it as well. Moreover, see if the intermediate

species is found in the genus stated: for whatever genus contains

the intermediate contains the extremes as well. Again, if the genus

have a contrary, look and see whether also the contrary species is

found in the contrary genus: for if so, clearly also the species in

question is found in the genus in question.

  Again, consider in the case of the inflexions and the co-ordinates

of species and genus, and see whether they follow likewise, both in

demolishing and in establishing a view. For whatever attribute belongs

or does not belong to one belongs or does not belong at the same

time to all; e.g. if justice be a particular form of knowledge, then

also 'justly' is 'knowingly' and the just man is a man of knowledge:

whereas if any of these things be not so, then neither is any of the

rest of them.



                                 4



  Again, consider the case of things that bear a like relation to

one another. Thus (e.g.) the relation of the pleasant to pleasure is

like that of the useful to the good: for in each case the one produces

the other. If therefore pleasure be a kind of 'good', then also the

pleasant will be a kind of 'useful': for clearly it may be taken to be

productive of good, seeing that pleasure is good. In the same way also

consider the case of processes of generation and destruction; if

(e.g.) to build be to be active, then to have built is to have been

active, and if to learn be to recollect, then also to have learnt is

to have recollected, and if to be decomposed be to be destroyed,

then to have been decomposed is to have been destroyed, and

decomposition is a kind of destruction. Consider also in the same

way the case of things that generate or destroy, and of the capacities

and uses of things; and in general, both in demolishing and in

establishing an argument, you should examine things in the light of

any resemblance of whatever description, as we were saying in the case

of generation and destruction. For if what tends to destroy tends to

decompose, then also to be destroyed is to be decomposed: and if

what tends to generate tends to produce, then to be generated is to be

produced, and generation is production. Likewise, also, in the case of

the capacities and uses of things: for if a capacity be a disposition,

then also to be capable of something is to be disposed to it, and if

the use of anything be an activity, then to use it is to be active,

and to have used it is to have been active.

  If the opposite of the species be a privation, there are two ways of

demolishing an argument, first of all by looking to see if the

opposite be found in the genus rendered: for either the privation is

to be found absolutely nowhere in the same genus, or at least not in

the same ultimate genus: e.g. if the ultimate genus containing sight

be sensation, then blindness will not be a sensation. Secondly, if

there be a sensation. Secondly, if there be a privation opposed to

both genus and species, but the opposite of the species be not found

in the opposite of the genus, then neither could the species

rendered be in the genus rendered. If, then, you are demolishing a

view, you should follow the rule as stated; but if establishing one

there is but one way: for if the opposite species be found in the

opposite genus, then also the species in question would be found in

the genus in question: e.g. if 'blindness' be a form of

'insensibility', then 'sight' is a form of 'sensation'.

  Again, look at the negations of the genus and species and convert

the order of terms, according to the method described in the case of

Accident: e.g. if the pleasant be a kind of good, what is not good

is not pleasant. For were this no something not good as well would

then be pleasant. That, however, cannot be, for it is impossible, if

'good' be the genus of pleasant, that anything not good should be

pleasant: for of things of which the genus is not predicated, none

of the species is predicated either. Also, in establishing a view, you

should adopt the same method of examination: for if what is not good

be not pleasant, then what is pleasant is good, so that 'good' is

the genus of 'pleasant'.

  If the species be a relative term, see whether the genus be a

relative term as well: for if the species be a relative term, so too

is the genus, as is the case with 'double' and 'multiple': for each is

a relative term. If, on the other hand, the genus be a relative

term, there is no necessity that the species should be so as well: for

'knowledge'is a relative term, but not so 'grammar'. Or possibly not

even the first statement would be generally considered true: for

virtue is a kind of 'noble' and a kind of 'good' thing, and yet, while

'virtue' is a relative term, 'good' and 'noble' are not relatives

but qualities. Again, see whether the species fails to be used in

the same relation when called by its own name, and when called by

the name of its genus: e.g. if the term 'double' be used to mean the

double of a 'half', then also the term 'multiple' ought to be used

to mean multiple of a 'half'. Otherwise 'multiple' could not be the

genus of 'double'.

  Moreover, see whether the term fail to be used in the same

relation both when called by the name of its genus, and also when

called by those of all the genera of its genus. For if the double be a

multiple of a half, then 'in excess of 'will also be used in

relation to a 'half': and, in general, the double will be called by

the names of all the higher genera in relation to a 'half'. An

objection may be raised that there is no necessity for a term to be

used in the same relation when called by its own name and when

called by that of its genus: for 'knowledge' is called knowledge 'of

an object', whereas it is called a 'state' and 'disposition' not of an

'object' but of the 'soul'.

  Again, see whether the genus and the species be used in the same way

in respect of the inflexions they take, e.g. datives and genitives and

all the rest. For as the species is used, so should the genus be as

well, as in the case of 'double' and its higher genera: for we say

both 'double of' and 'multiple of' a thing. Likewise, also, in the

case of 'knowledge': for both knowledge' itself and its genera, e.g.

'disposition' and 'state', are said to be 'of' something. An objection

may be raised that in some cases it is not so: for we say 'superior

to' and 'contrary to' so and so, whereas 'other', which is the genus

of these terms, demands not 'to' but 'than': for the expression is

'other than' so and so.

  Again, see whether terms used in like case relationships fail to

yield a like construction when converted, as do 'double' and

'multiple'. For each of these terms takes a genitive both in itself

and in its converted form: for we say both a half of' and 'a

fraction of' something. The case is the same also as regards both

'knowledge' and 'conception': for these take a genitive, and by

conversion an 'object of knowledge' and an 'object of conception'

are both alike used with a dative. If, then, in any cases the

constructions after conversion be not alike, clearly the one term is

not the genus of the other.

  Again, see whether the species and the genus fail to be used in

relation to an equal number of things: for the general view is that

the uses of both are alike and equal in number, as is the case with

'present' and 'grant'. For a present' is of something or to some

one, and also a 'grant' is of something and to some one: and 'grant'

is the genus of 'present', for a 'present' is a 'grant that need not

be returned'. In some cases, however, the number of relations in which

the terms are used happens not to be equal, for while 'double' is

double of something, we speak of 'in excess' or 'greater' in

something, as well as of or than something: for what is in excess or

greater is always in excess in something, as well as in excess of

something. Hence the terms in question are not the genera of 'double',

inasmuch as they are not used in relation to an equal number of things

with the species. Or possibly it is not universally true that

species and genus are used in relation to an equal number of things.

  See, also, if the opposite of the species have the opposite of the

genus as its genus, e.g. whether, if 'multiple' be the genus of

'double', 'fraction' be also the genus of 'half'. For the opposite

of the genus should always be the genus of the opposite species. If,

then, any one were to assert that knowledge is a kind of sensation,

then also the object of knowledge will have to be a kind of object

of sensation, whereas it is not: for an object of knowledge is not

always an object of sensation: for objects of knowledge include some

of the objects of intuition as well. Hence 'object of sensation' is

not the genus of 'object of knowledge': and if this be so, neither

is 'sensation' the genus of 'knowledge'.

  Seeing that of relative terms some are of necessity found in, or

used of, the things in relation to which they happen at any time to be

used (e.g. 'disposition' and 'state' and 'balance'; for in nothing

else can the aforesaid terms possibly be found except in the things in

relation to which they are used), while others need not be found in

the things in relation to which they are used at any time, though they

still may be (e.g. if the term 'object of knowledge' be applied to the

soul: for it is quite possible that the knowledge of itself should

be possessed by the soul itself, but it is not necessary, for it is

possible for this same knowledge to be found in some one else),

while for others, again, it is absolutely impossible that they

should be found in the things in relation to which they happen at

any time to be used (as e.g. that the contrary should be found in

the contrary or knowledge in the object of knowledge, unless the

object of knowledge happen to be a soul or a man)-you should look,

therefore, and see whether he places a term of one kind inside a genus

that is not of that kind, e.g. suppose he has said that 'memory' is

the 'abiding of knowledge'. For 'abiding' is always found in that

which abides, and is used of that, so that the abiding of knowledge

also will be found in knowledge. Memory, then, is found in

knowledge, seeing that it is the abiding of knowledge. But this is

impossible, for memory is always found in the soul. The aforesaid

commonplace rule is common to the subject of Accident as well: for

it is all the same to say that 'abiding' is the genus of memory, or to

allege that it is an accident of it. For if in any way whatever memory

be the abiding of knowledge, the same argument in regard to it will

apply.

                                 5



  Again, see if he has placed what is a 'state' inside the genus

'activity', or an activity inside the genus 'state', e.g. by

defining 'sensation' as 'movement communicated through the body':

for sensation is a 'state', whereas movement is an 'activity'.

Likewise, also, if he has said that memory is a 'state that is

retentive of a conception', for memory is never a state, but rather an

activity.

  They also make a bad mistake who rank a 'state' within the

'capacity' that attends it, e.g. by defining 'good temper' as the

'control of anger', and 'courage' and 'justice' as 'control of

fears' and of 'gains': for the terms 'courageous' and

'good-tempered' are applied to a man who is immune from passion,

whereas 'self-controlled' describes the man who is exposed to

passion and not led by it. Quite possibly, indeed, each of the

former is attended by a capacity such that, if he were exposed to

passion, he would control it and not be led by it: but, for all

that, this is not what is meant by being 'courageous' in the one case,

and 'good tempered' in the other; what is meant is an absolute

immunity from any passions of that kind at all.

  Sometimes, also, people state any kind of attendant feature as the

genus, e.g. 'pain' as the genus of 'anger' and 'conception' as that of

conviction'. For both of the things in question follow in a certain

sense upon the given species, but neither of them is genus to it.

For when the angry man feels pain, the pain bas appeared in him

earlier than the anger: for his anger is not the cause of his pain,

but his pain of his anger, so that anger emphatically is not pain.

By the same reasoning, neither is conviction conception: for it is

possible to have the same conception even without being convinced of

it, whereas this is impossible if conviction be a species of

conception: for it is impossible for a thing still to remain the

same if it be entirely transferred out of its species, just as neither

could the same animal at one time be, and at another not be, a man.

If, on the other hand, any one says that a man who has a conception

must of necessity be also convinced of it, then 'conception' and

'conviction' will be used with an equal denotation, so that not even

so could the former be the genus of the latter: for the denotation

of the genus should be wider.

  See, also, whether both naturally come to be anywhere in the same

thing: for what contains the species contains the genus as well:

e.g. what contains 'white' contains 'colour' as well, and what

contains 'knowledge of grammar' contains 'knowledge' as well. If,

therefore, any one says that 'shame' is 'fear', or that 'anger' is

'pain', the result will be that genus and species are not found in the

same thing: for shame is found in the 'reasoning' faculty, whereas

fear is in the 'spirited' faculty, and 'pain' is found in the

faculty of 'desires'. (for in this pleasure also is found), whereas

'anger' is found in the 'spirited' faculty. Hence the terms rendered

are not the genera, seeing that they do not naturally come to be in

the same faculty as the species. Likewise, also, if 'friendship' be

found in the faculty of desires, you may take it that it is not a form

of 'wishing': for wishing is always found in the 'reasoning'

faculty. This commonplace rule is useful also in dealing with

Accident: for the accident and that of which it is an accident are

both found in the same thing, so that if they do not appear in the

same thing, clearly it is not an accident.

  Again, see if the species partakes of the genus attributed only in

some particular respect: for it is the general view that the genus

is not thus imparted only in some particular respect: for a man is not

an animal in a particular respect, nor is grammar knowledge in a

particular respect only. Likewise also in other instances. Look,

therefore, and see if in the case of any of its species the genus be

imparted only in a certain respect; e.g. if 'animal' has been

described as an 'object of perception' or of 'sight'. For an animal is

an object of perception or of sight in a particular respect only;

for it is in respect of its body that it is perceived and seen, not in

respect of its soul, so that-'object of sight' and 'object of

perception' could not be the genus of 'animal'.

  Sometimes also people place the whole inside the part without

detection, defining (e.g.) 'animal' as an 'animate body'; whereas

the part is not predicated in any sense of the whole, so that 'body'

could not be the genus of animal, seeing that it is a part.

  See also if he has put anything that is blameworthy or objectionable

into the class 'capacity' or 'capable', e.g. by defining a 'sophist'

or a 'slanderer', or a 'thief' as 'one who is capable of secretly

thieving other people's property'. For none of the aforesaid

characters is so called because he is 'capable' in one of these

respects: for even God and the good man are capable of doing bad

things, but that is not their character: for it is always in respect

of their choice that bad men are so called. Moreover, a capacity is

always a desirable thing: for even the capacities for doing bad things

are desirable, and therefore it is we say that even God and the good

man possess them; for they are capable (we say) of doing evil. So then

'capacity' can never be the genus of anything blameworthy. Else, the

result will be that what is blameworthy is sometimes desirable: for

there will be a certain form of capacity that is blameworthy.

  Also, see if he has put anything that is precious or desirable for

its own sake into the class 'capacity' or 'capable' or 'productive' of

anything. For capacity, and what is capable or productive of anything,

is always desirable for the sake of something else.

  Or see if he has put anything that exists in two genera or more into

one of them only. For some things it is impossible to place in a

single genus, e.g. the 'cheat' and the 'slanderer': for neither he who

has the will without the capacity, nor he who has the capacity without

the will, is a slanderer or cheat, but he who has both of them.

Hence he must be put not into one genus, but into both the aforesaid

genera.

  Moreover, people sometimes in converse order render genus as

differentia, and differentia as genus, defining (e.g.) astonishment as

'excess of wonderment' and conviction as 'vehemence of conception'.

For neither 'excess' nor 'vehemence' is the genus, but the

differentia: for astonishment is usually taken to be an 'excessive

wonderment', and conviction to be a 'vehement conception', so that

'wonderment' and 'conception' are the genus, while 'excess' and

'vehemence' are the differentia. Moreover, if any one renders 'excess'

and 'vehemence' as genera, then inanimate things will be convinced and

astonished. For 'vehemence' and 'excess' of a thing are found in a

thing which is thus vehement and in excess. If, therefore,

astonishment be excess of wonderment the astonishment will be found in

the wonderment, so that 'wonderment' will be astonished! Likewise,

also, conviction will be found in the conception, if it be

'vehemence of conception', so that the conception will be convinced.

Moreover, a man who renders an answer in this style will in

consequence find himself calling vehemence vehement and excess

excessive: for there is such a thing as a vehement conviction: if then

conviction be 'vehemence', there would be a 'vehement vehemence'.

Likewise, also, there is such a thing as excessive astonishment: if

then astonishment be an excess, there would be an 'excessive

excess'. Whereas neither of these things is generally believed, any

more than that knowledge is a knower or motion a moving thing.

  Sometimes, too, people make the bad mistake of putting an

affection into that which is affected, as its genus, e.g. those who

say that immortality is everlasting life: for immortality seems to

be a certain affection or accidental feature of life. That this saying

is true would appear clear if any one were to admit that a man can

pass from being mortal and become immortal: for no one will assert

that he takes another life, but that a certain accidental feature or

affection enters into this one as it is. So then 'life' is not the

genus of immortality.

  Again, see if to an affection he has ascribed as genus the object of

which it is an affection, by defining (e.g.) wind as 'air in

motion'. Rather, wind is 'a movement of air': for the same air

persists both when it is in motion and when it is still. Hence wind is

not 'air' at all: for then there would also have been wind when the

air was not in motion, seeing that the same air which formed the

wind persists. Likewise, also, in other cases of the kind. Even, then,

if we ought in this instance to admit the point that wind is 'air in

motion', yet we should accept a definition of the kind, not about

all those things of which the genus is not true, but only in cases

where the genus rendered is a true predicate. For in some cases,

e.g. 'mud' or 'snow', it is not generally held to be true. For

people tell you that snow is 'frozen water' and mud is earth mixed

with moisture', whereas snow is not water, nor mud earth, so that

neither of the terms rendered could be the genus: for the genus should

be true of all its species. Likewise neither is wine 'fermented

water', as Empedocles speaks of 'water fermented in wood';' for it

simply is not water at all.



                                 6



  Moreover, see whether the term rendered fail to be the genus of

anything at all; for then clearly it also fails to be the genus of the

species mentioned. Examine the point by seeing whether the objects

that partake of the genus fail to be specifically different from one

another, e.g. white objects: for these do not differ specifically from

one another, whereas of a genus the species are always different, so

that 'white' could not be the genus of anything.

  Again, see whether he has named as genus or differentia some feature

that goes with everything: for the number of attributes that follow

everything is comparatively large: thus (e.g.) 'Being' and 'Unity' are

among the number of attributes that follow everything. If,

therefore, he has rendered 'Being' as a genus, clearly it would be the

genus of everything, seeing that it is predicated of everything; for

the genus is never predicated of anything except of its species. Hence

Unity, inter alia, will be a species of Being. The result,

therefore, is that of all things of which the genus is predicated, the

species is predicated as well, seeing that Being and Unity are

predicates of absolutely everything, whereas the predication of the

species ought to be of narrower range. If, on the other hand, he has

named as differentia some attribute that follows everything, clearly

the denotation of the differentia will be equal to, or wider than,

that of the genus. For if the genus, too, be some attribute that

follows everything, the denotation of the differentia will be equal to

its denotation, while if the genus do not follow everything, it will

be still wider.

  Moreover, see if the description 'inherent in S' be used of the

genus rendered in relation to its species, as it is used of 'white' in

the case of snow, thus showing clearly that it could not be the genus:

for 'true of S' is the only description used of the genus in

relation to its species. Look and see also if the genus fails to be

synonymous with its species. For the genus is always predicated of its

species synonymously.

  Moreover, beware, whenever both species and genus have a contrary,

and he places the better of the contraries inside the worse genus: for

the result will be that the remaining species will be found in the

remaining genus, seeing that contraries are found in contrary

genera, so that the better species will be found in the worse genus

and the worse in the better: whereas the usual view is that of the

better species the genus too is better. Also see if he has placed

the species inside the worse and not inside the better genus, when

it is at the same time related in like manner to both, as (e.g.) if he

has defined the 'soul' as a 'form of motion' or 'a form of moving

thing'. For the same soul is usually thought to be a principle alike

of rest and of motion, so that, if rest is the better of the two, this

is the genus into which the soul should have been put.

  Moreover, judge by means of greater and less degrees: if

overthrowing a view, see whether the genus admits of a greater degree,

whereas neither the species itself does so, nor any term that is

called after it: e.g. if virtue admits of a greater degree, so too

does justice and the just man: for one man is called 'more just than

another'. If, therefore, the genus rendered admits of a greater

degree, whereas neither the species does so itself nor yet any term

called after it, then what has been rendered could not be the genus.

  Again, if what is more generally, or as generally, thought to be the

genus be not so, clearly neither is the genus rendered. The

commonplace rule in question is useful especially in cases where the

species appears to have several predicates in the category of essence,

and where no distinction has been drawn between them, and we cannot

say which of them is genus; e.g. both 'pain' and the 'conception of

a slight' are usually thought to be predicates of 'anger in the

category of essence: for the angry man is both in pain and also

conceives that he is slighted. The same mode of inquiry may be applied

also to the case of the species, by comparing it with some other

species: for if the one which is more generally, or as generally,

thought to be found in the genus rendered be not found therein, then

clearly neither could the species rendered be found therein.

  In demolishing a view, therefore, you should follow the rule as

stated. In establishing one, on the other hand, the commonplace rule

that you should see if both the genus rendered and the species admit

of a greater degree will not serve: for even though both admit it,

it is still possible for one not to be the genus of the other. For

both 'beautiful' and 'white' admit of a greater degree, and neither is

the genus of the other. On the other hand, the comparison of the

genera and of the species one with another is of use: e.g. supposing A

and B to have a like claim to be genus, then if one be a genus, so

also is the other. Likewise, also, if what has less claim be a

genus, so also is what has more claim: e.g. if 'capacity' have more

claim than 'virtue' to be the genus of self-control, and virtue be the

genus, so also is capacity. The same observations will apply also in

the case of the species. For instance, supposing A and B to have a

like claim to be a species of the genus in question, then if the one

be a species, so also is the other: and if that which is less

generally thought to be so be a species, so also is that which is more

generally thought to be so.

  Moreover, to establish a view, you should look and see if the

genus is predicated in the category of essence of those things of

which it has been rendered as the genus, supposing the species

rendered to be not one single species but several different ones:

for then clearly it will be the genus. If, on the other, the species

rendered be single, look and see whether the genus be predicated in

the category of essence of other species as well: for then, again, the

result will be that it is predicated of several different species.

  Since some people think that the differentia, too, is a predicate of

the various species in the category of essence, you should distinguish

the genus from the differentia by employing the aforesaid elementary

principles-(a) that the genus has a wider denotation than the

differentia; (b) that in rendering the essence of a thing it is more

fitting to state the genus than the differentia: for any one who

says that 'man' is an 'animal' shows what man is better than he who

describes him as 'walking'; also (c) that the differentia always

signifies a quality of the genus, whereas the genus does not do this

of the differentia: for he who says 'walking' describes an animal of a

certain quality, whereas he who says 'animal' describes an animal of a

certain quality, whereas he who says 'animal' does not describe a

walking thing of a certain quality.

  The differentia, then, should be distinguished from the genus in

this manner. Now seeing it is generally held that if what is

musical, in being musical, possesses knowledge in some respect, then

also 'music' is a particular kind of 'knowledge'; and also that if

what walks is moved in walking, then 'walking' is a particular kind of

'movement'; you should therefore examine in the aforesaid manner any

genus in which you want to establish the existence of something;

e.g. if you wish to prove that 'knowledge' is a form of

'conviction', see whether the knower in knowing is convinced: for then

clearly knowledge would be a particular kind of conviction. You should

proceed in the same way also in regard to the other cases of this

kind.

  Moreover, seeing that it is difficult to distinguish whatever always

follows along with a thing, and is not convertible with it, from its

genus, if A follows B universally, whereas B does not follow A

universally-as e.g. 'rest' always follows a 'calm' and

'divisibility' follows 'number', but not conversely (for the divisible

is not always a number, nor rest a calm)-you may yourself assume in

your treatment of them that the one which always follows is the genus,

whenever the other is not convertible with it: if, on the other

hand, some one else puts forward the proposition, do not accept it

universally. An objection to it is that 'not-being' always follows

what is 'coming to be' (for what is coming to be is not) and is not

convertible with it (for what is not is not always coming to be),

and that still 'not-being' is not the genus of 'coming to be': for

'not-being' has not any species at all. Questions, then, in regard

to Genus should be investigated in the ways described.
