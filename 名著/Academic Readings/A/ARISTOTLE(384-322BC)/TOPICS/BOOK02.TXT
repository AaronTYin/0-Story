  Of problems some are universal, others particular. Universal

problems are such as 'Every pleasure is good' and 'No pleasure is

good'; particular problems are such as 'Some pleasure is good' and

'Some pleasure is not good'. The methods of establishing and

overthrowing a view universally are common to both kinds of

problems; for when we have shown that a predicate belongs in every

case, we shall also have shown that it belongs in some cases.

Likewise, also, if we show that it does not belong in any case, we

shall also have shown that it does not belong in every case. First,

then, we must speak of the methods of overthrowing a view universally,

because such are common to both universal and particular problems, and

because people more usually introduce theses asserting a predicate

than denying it, while those who argue with them overthrow it. The

conversion of an appropriate name which is drawn from the element

'accident' is an extremely precarious thing; for in the case of

accidents and in no other it is possible for something to be true

conditionally and not universally. Names drawn from the elements

'definition' and 'property' and 'genus' are bound to be convertible;

e.g. if 'to be an animal that walks on two feet is an attribute of S',

then it will be true by conversion to say that 'S is an animal that

walks on two feet'. Likewise, also, if drawn from the genus; for if

'to be an animal is an attribute of S', then 'S is an animal'. The

same is true also in the case of a property; for if 'to be capable

of learning grammar is an attribute of S', then 'S will be capable

of learning grammar'. For none of these attributes can possibly belong

or not belong in part; they must either belong or not belong

absolutely. In the case of accidents, on the other hand, there is

nothing to prevent an attribute (e.g. whiteness or justice)

belonging in part, so that it is not enough to show that whiteness

or justice is an attribute of a man in order to show that he is

white or just; for it is open to dispute it and say that he is white

or just in part only. Conversion, then, is not a necessary process

in the case of accidents.

  We must also define the errors that occur in problems. They are of

two kinds, caused either by false statement or by transgression of the

established diction. For those who make false statements, and say that

an attribute belongs to thing which does not belong to it, commit

error; and those who call objects by the names of other objects

(e.g. calling a planetree a 'man') transgress the established

terminology.



                                 2



  Now one commonplace rule is to look and see if a man has ascribed as

an accident what belongs in some other way. This mistake is most

commonly made in regard to the genera of things, e.g. if one were to

say that white happens (accidit) to be a colour-for being a colour

does not happen by accident to white, but colour is its genus. The

assertor may of course define it so in so many words, saying (e.g.)

that 'Justice happens (accidit) to be a virtue'; but often even

without such definition it is obvious that he has rendered the genus

as an accident; e.g. suppose that one were to say that whiteness is

coloured or that walking is in motion. For a predicate drawn from

the genus is never ascribed to the species in an inflected form, but

always the genera are predicated of their species literally; for the

species take on both the name and the definition of their genera. A

man therefore who says that white is 'coloured' has not rendered

'coloured' as its genus, seeing that he has used an inflected form,

nor yet as its property or as its definition: for the definition and

property of a thing belong to it and to nothing else, whereas many

things besides white are coloured, e.g. a log, a stone, a man, and a

horse. Clearly then he renders it as an accident.

  Another rule is to examine all cases where a predicate has been

either asserted or denied universally to belong to something. Look

at them species by species, and not in their infinite multitude: for

then the inquiry will proceed more directly and in fewer steps. You

should look and begin with the most primary groups, and then proceed

in order down to those that are not further divisible: e.g. if a man

has said that the knowledge of opposites is the same, you should

look and see whether it be so of relative opposites and of

contraries and of terms signifying the privation or presence of

certain states, and of contradictory terms. Then, if no clear result

be reached so far in these cases, you should again divide these

until you come to those that are not further divisible, and see (e.g.)

whether it be so of just deeds and unjust, or of the double and the

half, or of blindness and sight, or of being and not-being: for if

in any case it be shown that the knowledge of them is not the same

we shall have demolished the problem. Likewise, also, if the predicate

belongs in no case. This rule is convertible for both destructive

and constructive purposes: for if, when we have suggested a

division, the predicate appears to hold in all or in a large number of

cases, we may then claim that the other should actually assert it

universally, or else bring a negative instance to show in what case it

is not so: for if he does neither of these things, a refusal to assert

it will make him look absurd.

  Another rule is to make definitions both of an accident and of its

subject, either of both separately or else of one of them, and then

look and see if anything untrue has been assumed as true in the

definitions. Thus (e.g.) to see if it is possible to wrong a god,

ask what is 'to wrong'? For if it be 'to injure deliberately', clearly

it is not possible for a god to be wronged: for it is impossible

that God should be injured. Again, to see if the good man is

jealous, ask who is the 'jealous' man and what is 'jealousy'. For if

'jealousy' is pain at the apparent success of some well-behaved

person, clearly the good man is not jealous: for then he would be bad.

Again, to see if the indignant man is jealous, ask who each of them

is: for then it will be obvious whether the statement is true or

false; e.g. if he is 'jealous' who grieves at the successes of the

good, and he is 'indignant' who grieves at the successes of the

evil, then clearly the indignant man would not be jealous. A man

should substitute definitions also for the terms contained in his

definitions, and not stop until he comes to a familiar term: for often

if the definition be rendered whole, the point at issue is not cleared

up, whereas if for one of the terms used in the definition a

definition be stated, it becomes obvious.

  Moreover, a man should make the problem into a proposition for

himself, and then bring a negative instance against it: for the

negative instance will be a ground of attack upon the assertion.

This rule is very nearly the same as the rule to look into cases where

a predicate has been attributed or denied universally: but it

differs in the turn of the argument.

  Moreover, you should define what kind of things should be called

as most men call them, and what should not. For this is useful both

for establishing and for overthrowing a view: e.g. you should say that

we ought to use our terms to mean the same things as most people

mean by them, but when we ask what kind of things are or are not of

such and such a kind, we should not here go with the multitude: e.g.

it is right to call 'healthy' whatever tends to produce health, as

do most men: but in saying whether the object before us tends to

produce health or not, we should adopt the language no longer of the

multitude but of the doctor.



                                 3



  Moreover, if a term be used in several senses, and it has been

laid down that it is or that it is not an attribute of S, you should

show your case of one of its several senses, if you cannot show it

of both. This rule is to be observed in cases where the difference

of meaning is undetected; for supposing this to be obvious, then the

other man will object that the point which he himself questioned has

not been discussed, but only the other point. This commonplace rule is

convertible for purposes both of establishing and of overthrowing a

view. For if we want to establish a statement, we shall show that in

one sense the attribute belongs, if we cannot show it of both

senses: whereas if we are overthrowing a statement, we shall show that

in one sense the attribute does not belong, if we cannot show it of

both senses. Of course, in overthrowing a statement there is no need

to start the discussion by securing any admission, either when the

statement asserts or when it denies the attribute universally: for

if we show that in any case whatever the attribute does not belong, we

shall have demolished the universal assertion of it, and likewise also

if we show that it belongs in a single case, we shall demolish the

universal denial of it. Whereas in establishing a statement we ought

to secure a preliminary admission that if it belongs in any case

whatever, it belongs universally, supposing this claim to be a

plausible one. For it is not enough to discuss a single instance in

order to show that an attribute belongs universally; e.g. to argue

that if the soul of man be immortal, then every soul is immortal, so

that a previous admission must be secured that if any soul whatever be

immortal, then every soul is immortal. This is not to be done in every

case, but only whenever we are not easily able to quote any single

argument applying to all cases in common, as (e.g.) the geometrician

can argue that the triangle has its angles equal to two right angles.

  If, again, the variety of meanings of a term be obvious, distinguish

how many meanings it has before proceeding either to demolish or to

establish it: e.g. supposing 'the right' to mean 'the expedient' or

'the honourable', you should try either to establish or to demolish

both descriptions of the subject in question; e.g. by showing that

it is honourable and expedient, or that it is neither honourable nor

expedient. Supposing, however, that it is impossible to show both, you

should show the one, adding an indication that it is true in the one

sense and not in the other. The same rule applies also when the number

of senses into which it is divided is more than two.

  Again, consider those expressions whose meanings are many, but

differ not by way of ambiguity of a term, but in some other way:

e.g. 'The science of many things is one': here 'many things' may

mean the end and the means to that end, as (e.g.) medicine is the

science both of producing health and of dieting; or they may be both

of them ends, as the science of contraries is said to be the same (for

of contraries the one is no more an end than the other); or again they

may be an essential and an accidental attribute, as (e.g.) the

essential fact that the triangle has its angles equal to two right

angles, and the accidental fact that the equilateral figure has them

so: for it is because of the accident of the equilateral triangle

happening to be a triangle that we know that it has its angles equal

to two right angles. If, then, it is not possible in any sense of

the term that the science of many things should be the same, it

clearly is altogether impossible that it should be so; or, if it is

possible in some sense, then clearly it is possible. Distinguish as

many meanings as are required: e.g. if we want to establish a view, we

should bring forward all such meanings as admit that view and should

divide them only into those meanings which also are required for the

establishment of our case: whereas if we want to overthrow a view,

we should bring forward all that do not admit that view, and leave the

rest aside. We must deal also in these cases as well with any

uncertainty about the number of meanings involved. Further, that one

thing is, or is not, 'of' another should be established by means of

the same commonplace rules; e.g. that a particular science is of a

particular thing, treated either as an end or as a means to its end,

or as accidentally connected with it; or again that it is not 'of'

it in any of the aforesaid ways. The same rule holds true also of

desire and all other terms that have more than one object. For the

'desire of X' may mean the desire of it as an end (e.g. the desire

of health) or as a means to an end (e.g. the desire of being

doctored), or as a thing desired accidentally, as, in the case of

wine, the sweet-toothed person desires it not because it is wine but

because it is sweet. For essentially he desires the sweet, and only

accidentally the wine: for if it be dry, he no longer desires it.

His desire for it is therefore accidental. This rule is useful in

dealing with relative terms: for cases of this kind are generally

cases of relative terms.



                                 4



  Moreover, it is well to alter a term into one more familiar, e.g. to

substitute 'clear' for 'exact' in describing a conception, and

'being fussy' for 'being busy': for when the expression is made more

familiar, the thesis becomes easier to attack. This commonplace rule

also is available for both purposes alike, both for establishing and

for overthrowing a view.

  In order to show that contrary attributes belong to the same

thing, look at its genus; e.g. if we want to show that rightness and

wrongness are possible in regard to perception, and to perceive is

to judge, while it is possible to judge rightly or wrongly, then in

regard to perception as well rightness and wrongness must be possible.

In the present instance the proof proceeds from the genus and

relates to the species: for 'to judge' is the genus of 'to -perceive';

for the man who perceives judges in a certain way. But per contra it

may proceed from the species to the genus: for all the attributes that

belong to the species belong to the genus as well; e.g. if there is

a bad and a good knowledge there is also a bad and a good disposition:

for 'disposition' is the genus of knowledge. Now the former

commonplace argument is fallacious for purposes of establishing a

view, while the second is true. For there is no necessity that all the

attributes that belong to the genus should belong also to the species;

for 'animal' is flying and quadruped, but not so 'man'. All the

attributes, on the other hand, that belong to the species must of

necessity belong also to the genus; for if 'man' is good, then

animal also is good. On the other hand, for purposes of overthrowing a

view, the former argument is true while the latter is fallacious;

for all the attributes which do not belong to the genus do not

belong to the species either; whereas all those that are wanting to

the species are not of necessity wanting to the genus.

  Since those things of which the genus is predicated must also of

necessity have one of its species predicated of them, and since

those things that are possessed of the genus in question, or are

described by terms derived from that genus, must also of necessity

be possessed of one of its species or be described by terms derived

from one of its species (e.g. if to anything the term 'scientific

knowledge' be applied, then also there will be applied to it the

term 'grammatical' or 'musical' knowledge, or knowledge of one of

the other sciences; and if any one possesses scientific knowledge or

is described by a term derived from 'science', then he will also

possess grammatical or musical knowledge or knowledge of one of the

other sciences, or will be described by a term derived from one of

them, e.g. as a 'grammarian' or a 'musician')-therefore if any

expression be asserted that is in any way derived from the genus (e.g.

that the soul is in motion), look and see whether it be possible for

the soul to be moved with any of the species of motion; whether (e.g.)

it can grow or be destroyed or come to be, and so forth with all the

other species of motion. For if it be not moved in any of these

ways, clearly it does not move at all. This commonplace rule is common

for both purposes, both for overthrowing and for establishing a

view: for if the soul moves with one of the species of motion, clearly

it does move; while if it does not move with any of the species of

motion, clearly it does not move.

  If you are not well equipped with an argument against the assertion,

look among the definitions, real or apparent, of the thing before you,

and if one is not enough, draw upon several. For it will be easier

to attack people when committed to a definition: for an attack is

always more easily made on definitions.

  Moreover, look and see in regard to the thing in question, what it

is whose reality conditions the reality of the thing in question, or

what it is whose reality necessarily follows if the thing in

question be real: if you wish to establish a view inquire what there

is on whose reality the reality of the thing in question will follow

(for if the former be shown to be real, then the thing in question

will also have been shown to be real); while if you want to

overthrow a view, ask what it is that is real if the thing in question

be real, for if we show that what follows from the thing in question

is unreal, we shall have demolished the thing in question.

  Moreover, look at the time involved, to see if there be any

discrepancy anywhere: e.g. suppose a man to have stated that what is

being nourished of necessity grows: for animals are always of

necessity being nourished, but they do not always grow. Likewise,

also, if he has said that knowing is remembering: for the one is

concerned with past time, whereas the other has to do also with the

present and the future. For we are said to know things present and

future (e.g. that there will be an eclipse), whereas it is

impossible to remember anything save what is in the past.



                                 5



  Moreover, there is the sophistic turn of argument, whereby we draw

our opponent into the kind of statement against which we shall be well

supplied with lines of argument. This process is sometimes a real

necessity, sometimes an apparent necessity, sometimes neither an

apparent nor a real necessity. It is really necessary whenever the

answerer has denied any view that would be useful in attacking the

thesis, and the questioner thereupon addresses his arguments to the

support of this view, and when moreover the view in question happens

to be one of a kind on which he has a good stock of lines of argument.

Likewise, also, it is really necessary whenever he (the questioner)

first, by an induction made by means of the view laid down, arrives at

a certain statement and then tries to demolish that statement: for

when once this has been demolished, the view originally laid down is

demolished as well. It is an apparent necessity, when the point to

which the discussion comes to be directed appears to be useful, and

relevant to the thesis, without being really so; whether it be that

the man who is standing up to the argument has refused to concede

something, or whether he (the questioner) has first reached it by a

plausible induction based upon the thesis and then tries to demolish

it. The remaining case is when the point to which the discussion comes

to be directed is neither really nor apparently necessary, and it is

the answerer's luck to be confuted on a mere side issue You should

beware of the last of the aforesaid methods; for it appears to be

wholly disconnected from, and foreign to, the art of dialectic. For

this reason, moreover, the answerer should not lose his temper, but

assent to those statements that are of no use in attacking the thesis,

adding an indication whenever he assents although he does not agree

with the view. For, as a rule, it increases the confusion of

questioners if, after all propositions of this kind have been

granted them, they can then draw no conclusion.

  Moreover, any one who has made any statement whatever has in a

certain sense made several statements, inasmuch as each statement

has a number of necessary consequences: e.g. the man who said 'X is

a man' has also said that it is an animal and that it is animate and a

biped and capable of acquiring reason and knowledge, so that by the

demolition of any single one of these consequences, of whatever

kind, the original statement is demolished as well. But you should

beware here too of making a change to a more difficult subject: for

sometimes the consequence, and sometimes the original thesis, is the

easier to demolish.



                                 6



  In regard to subjects which must have one and one only of two

predicates, as (e.g.) a man must have either a disease or health,

supposing we are well supplied as regards the one for arguing its

presence or absence, we shall be well equipped as regards the

remaining one as well. This rule is convertible for both purposes: for

when we have shown that the one attribute belongs, we shall have shown

that the remaining one does not belong; while if we show that the

one does not belong, we shall have shown that the remaining one does

belong. Clearly then the rule is useful for both purposes.

  Moreover, you may devise a line of attack by reinterpreting a term

in its literal meaning, with the implication that it is most fitting

so to take it rather than in its established meaning: e.g. the

expression 'strong at heart' will suggest not the courageous man,

according to the use now established, but the man the state of whose

heart is strong; just as also the expression 'of a good hope' may be

taken to mean the man who hopes for good things. Likewise also

'well-starred' may be taken to mean the man whose star is good, as

Xenocrates says 'well-starred is he who has a noble soul'.' For a

man's star is his soul.

  Some things occur of necessity, others usually, others however it

may chance; if therefore a necessary event has been asserted to

occur usually, or if a usual event (or, failing such an event

itself, its contrary) has been stated to occur of necessity, it always

gives an opportunity for attack. For if a necessary event has been

asserted to occur usually, clearly the speaker has denied an attribute

to be universal which is universal, and so has made a mistake: and

so he has if he has declared the usual attribute to be necessary:

for then he declares it to belong universally when it does not so

belong. Likewise also if he has declared the contrary of what is usual

to be necessary. For the contrary of a usual attribute is always a

comparatively rare attribute: e.g. if men are usually bad, they are

comparatively seldom good, so that his mistake is even worse if he has

declared them to be good of necessity. The same is true also if he has

declared a mere matter of chance to happen of necessity or usually;

for a chance event happens neither of necessity nor usually. If the

thing happens usually, then even supposing his statement does not

distinguish whether he meant that it happens usually or that it

happens necessarily, it is open to you to discuss it on the assumption

that he meant that it happens necessarily: e.g. if he has stated

without any distinction that disinherited persons are bad, you may

assume in discussing it that he means that they are so necessarily.

  Moreover, look and see also if he has stated a thing to be an

accident of itself, taking it to be a different thing because it has a

different name, as Prodicus used to divide pleasures into joy and

delight and good cheer: for all these are names of the same thing,

to wit, Pleasure. If then any one says that joyfulness is an

accidental attribute of cheerfulness, he would be declaring it to be

an accidental attribute of itself.



                                 7



  Inasmuch as contraries can be conjoined with each other in six ways,

and four of these conjunctions constitute a contrariety, we must grasp

the subject of contraries, in order that it may help us both in

demolishing and in establishing a view. Well then, that the modes of

conjunction are six is clear: for either (1) each of the contrary

verbs will be conjoined to each of the contrary objects; and this

gives two modes: e.g. to do good to friends and to do evil to enemies,

or per contra to do evil to friends and to do good to enemies. Or else

(2) both verbs may be attached to one object; and this too gives two

modes, e.g. to do good to friends and to do evil to friends, or to

do good to enemies and to do evil to enemies. Or (3) a single verb may

be attached to both objects: and this also gives two modes; e.g. to do

good to friends and to do good to enemies, or to do evil to friends

and evil to enemies.

  The first two then of the aforesaid conjunctions do not constitute

any contrariety; for the doing of good to friends is not contrary to

the doing of evil to enemies: for both courses are desirable and

belong to the same disposition. Nor is the doing of evil to friends

contrary to the doing of good to enemies: for both of these are

objectionable and belong to the same disposition: and one

objectionable thing is not generally thought to be the contrary of

another, unless the one be an expression denoting an excess, and the

other an expression denoting a defect: for an excess is generally

thought to belong to the class of objectionable things, and likewise

also a defect. But the other four all constitute a contrariety. For to

do good to friends is contrary to the doing of evil to friends: for it

proceeds from the contrary disposition, and the one is desirable,

and the other objectionable. The case is the same also in regard to

the other conjunctions: for in each combination the one course is

desirable, and the other objectionable, and the one belongs to a

reasonable disposition and the other to a bad. Clearly, then, from

what has been said, the same course has more than one contrary. For

the doing of good to friends has as its contrary both the doing of

good to enemies and the doing of evil to friends. Likewise, if we

examine them in the same way, we shall find that the contraries of

each of the others also are two in number. Select therefore

whichever of the two contraries is useful in attacking the thesis.

  Moreover, if the accident of a thing have a contrary, see whether it

belongs to the subject to which the accident in question has been

declared to belong: for if the latter belongs the former could not

belong; for it is impossible that contrary predicates should belong at

the same time to the same thing.

  Or again, look and see if anything has been said about something, of

such a kind that if it be true, contrary predicates must necessarily

belong to the thing: e.g. if he has said that the 'Ideas' exist in us.

For then the result will be that they are both in motion and at

rest, and moreover that they are objects both of sensation and of

thought. For according to the views of those who posit the existence

of Ideas, those Ideas are at rest and are objects of thought; while if

they exist in us, it is impossible that they should be unmoved: for

when we move, it follows necessarily that all that is in us moves with

us as well. Clearly also they are objects of sensation, if they

exist in us: for it is through the sensation of sight that we

recognize the Form present in each individual.

  Again, if there be posited an accident which has a contrary, look

and see if that which admits of the accident will admit of its

contrary as well: for the same thing admits of contraries. Thus (e.g.)

if he has asserted that hatred follows anger, hatred would in that

case be in the 'spirited faculty': for that is where anger is. You

should therefore look and see if its contrary, to wit, friendship,

be also in the 'spirited faculty': for if not-if friendship is in

the faculty of desire-then hatred could not follow anger. Likewise

also if he has asserted that the faculty of desire is ignorant. For if

it were capable of ignorance, it would be capable of knowledge as

well: and this is not generally held-I mean that the faculty of desire

is capable of knowledge. For purposes, then, of overthrowing a view,

as has been said, this rule should be observed: but for purposes of

establishing one, though the rule will not help you to assert that the

accident actually belongs, it will help you to assert that it may

possibly belong. For having shown that the thing in question will

not admit of the contrary of the accident asserted, we shall have

shown that the accident neither belongs nor can possibly belong; while

on the other hand, if we show that the contrary belongs, or that the

thing is capable of the contrary, we shall not indeed as yet have

shown that the accident asserted does belong as well; our proof will

merely have gone to this point, that it is possible for it to belong.



                                 8



  Seeing that the modes of opposition are four in number, you should

look for arguments among the contradictories of your terms, converting

the order of their sequence, both when demolishing and when

establishing a view, and you should secure them by means of

induction-such arguments (e.g.) as that man be an animal, what is

not an animal is not a man': and likewise also in other instances of

contradictories. For in those cases the sequence is converse: for

'animal' follows upon 'man but 'not-animal' does not follow upon

'not-man', but conversely 'not-man' upon 'not-animal'. In all cases,

therefore, a postulate of this sort should be made, (e.g.) that 'If

the honourable is pleasant, what is not pleasant is not honourable,

while if the latter be untrue, so is the former'. Likewise, also,

'If what is not pleasant be not honourable, then what is honourable is

pleasant'. Clearly, then, the conversion of the sequence formed by

contradiction of the terms of the thesis is a method convertible for

both purposes.

  Then look also at the case of the contraries of S and P in the

thesis, and see if the contrary of the one follows upon the contrary

of the other, either directly or conversely, both when you are

demolishing and when you are establishing a view: secure arguments

of this kind as well by means of induction, so far as may be required.

Now the sequence is direct in a case such as that of courage and

cowardice: for upon the one of them virtue follows, and vice upon

the other; and upon the one it follows that it is desirable, while

upon the other it follows that it is objectionable. The sequence,

therefore, in the latter case also is direct; for the desirable is the

contrary of the objectionable. Likewise also in other cases. The

sequence is, on the other hand, converse in such a case as this:

Health follows upon vigour, but disease does not follow upon debility;

rather debility follows upon disease. In this case, then, clearly

the sequence is converse. Converse sequence is, however, rare in the

case of contraries; usually the sequence is direct. If, therefore, the

contrary of the one term does not follow upon the contrary of the

other either directly or conversely, clearly neither does the one term

follow upon the other in the statement made: whereas if the one

followed the other in the case of the contraries, it must of necessity

do so as well in the original statement.

  You should look also into cases of the privation or presence of a

state in like manner to the case of contraries. Only, in the case of

such privations the converse sequence does not occur: the sequence

is always bound to be direct: e.g. as sensation follows sight, while

absence of sensation follows blindness. For the opposition of

sensation to absence of sensation is an opposition of the presence

to the privation of a state: for the one of them is a state, and the

other the privation of it.

  The case of relative terms should also be studied in like manner

to that of a state and its privation: for the sequence of these as

well is direct; e.g. if 3/1 is a multiple, then 1/3 is a fraction: for

3/1 is relative to 1/3, and so is a multiple to a fraction. Again,

if knowledge be a conceiving, then also the object of knowledge is

an object of conception; and if sight be a sensation, then also the

object of sight is an object of sensation. An objection may be made

that there is no necessity for the sequence to take place, in the case

of relative terms, in the way described: for the object of sensation

is an object of knowledge, whereas sensation is not knowledge. The

objection is, however, not generally received as really true; for many

people deny that there is knowledge of objects of sensation. Moreover,

the principle stated is just as useful for the contrary purpose,

e.g. to show that the object of sensation is not an object of

knowledge, on the ground that neither is sensation knowledge.



                                 9



  Again look at the case of the co-ordinates and inflected forms of

the terms in the thesis, both in demolishing and in establishing it.

By co-ordinates' are meant terms such as the following: 'Just deeds'

and the 'just man' are coordinates of 'justice', and 'courageous

deeds' and the 'courageous man' are co-ordinates of courage.

Likewise also things that tend to produce and to preserve anything are

called co-ordinates of that which they tend to produce and to

preserve, as e.g. 'healthy habits' are co-ordinates of 'health' and

a 'vigorous constitutional' of a 'vigorous constitution' and so

forth also in other cases. 'Co-ordinate', then, usually describes

cases such as these, whereas 'inflected forms' are such as the

following: 'justly', 'courageously', 'healthily', and such as are

formed in this way. It is usually held that words when used in their

inflected forms as well are co-ordinates, as (e.g.) 'justly' in

relation to justice, and 'courageously' to courage; and then

'co-ordinate' describes all the members of the same kindred series,

e.g. 'justice', 'just', of a man or an act, 'justly'. Clearly, then,

when any one member, whatever its kind, of the same kindred series

is shown to be good or praiseworthy, then all the rest as well come to

be shown to be so: e.g. if 'justice' be something praiseworthy, then

so will 'just', of a man or thing, and 'justly' connote something

praiseworthy. Then 'justly' will be rendered also 'praiseworthily',

derived will by the same inflexion from 'the praiseworthy' whereby

'justly' is derived from 'justice'.

  Look not only in the case of the subject mentioned, but also in

the case of its contrary, for the contrary predicate: e.g. argue

that good is not necessarily pleasant; for neither is evil painful: or

that, if the latter be the case, so is the former. Also, if justice be

knowledge, then injustice is ignorance: and if 'justly' means

'knowingly' and 'skilfully', then 'unjustly' means 'ignorantly' and

'unskilfully': whereas if the latter be not true, neither is the

former, as in the instance given just now: for 'unjustly' is more

likely to seem equivalent to 'skilfully' than to 'unskilfully'. This

commonplace rule has been stated before in dealing with the sequence

of contraries; for all we are claiming now is that the contrary of P

shall follow the contrary of S.

  Moreover, look at the modes of generation and destruction of a

thing, and at the things which tend to produce or to destroy it,

both in demolishing and in establishing a view. For those things whose

modes of generation rank among good things, are themselves also

good; and if they themselves be good, so also are their modes of

generation. If, on the other hand, their modes of generation be

evil, then they themselves also are evil. In regard to modes of

destruction the converse is true: for if the modes of destruction rank

as good things, then they themselves rank as evil things; whereas if

the modes of destruction count as evil, they themselves count as good.

The same argument applies also to things tending to produce and

destroy: for things whose productive causes are good, themselves

also rank as good; whereas if causes destructive of them are good,

they themselves rank as evil.



                                10



  Again, look at things which are like the subject in question, and

see if they are in like case; e.g. if one branch of knowledge has more

than one object, so also will one opinion; and if to possess sight

be to see, then also to possess hearing will be to hear. Likewise also

in the case of other things, both those which are and those which

are generally held to be like. The rule in question is useful for both

purposes; for if it be as stated in the case of some one like thing,

it is so with the other like things as well, whereas if it be not so

in the case of some one of them, neither is it so in the case of the

others. Look and see also whether the cases are alike as regards a

single thing and a number of things: for sometimes there is a

discrepancy. Thus, if to 'know' a thing be to 'think of' it, then also

to 'know many things' is to 'be thinking of many things'; whereas this

is not true; for it is possible to know many things but not to be

thinking of them. If, then, the latter proposition be not true,

neither was the former that dealt with a single thing, viz. that to

'know' a thing is to 'think of' it.

  Moreover, argue from greater and less degrees. In regard to

greater degrees there are four commonplace rules. One is: See

whether a greater degree of the predicate follows a greater degree

of the subject: e.g. if pleasure be good, see whether also a greater

pleasure be a greater good: and if to do a wrong be evil, see

whether also to do a greater wrong is a greater evil. Now this rule is

of use for both purposes: for if an increase of the accident follows

an increase of the subject, as we have said, clearly the accident

belongs; while if it does not follow, the accident does not belong.

You should establish this by induction. Another rule is: If one

predicate be attributed to two subjects; then supposing it does not

belong to the subject to which it is the more likely to belong,

neither does it belong where it is less likely to belong; while if

it does belong where it is less likely to belong, then it belongs as

well where it is more likely. Again: If two predicates be attributed

to one subject, then if the one which is more generally thought to

belong does not belong, neither does the one that is less generally

thought to belong; or, if the one that is less generally thought to

belong does belong, so also does the other. Moreover: If two

predicates be attributed to two subjects, then if the one which is

more usually thought to belong to the one subject does not belong,

neither does the remaining predicate belong to the remaining

subject; or, if the one which is less usually thought to belong to the

one subject does belong, so too does the remaining predicate to the

remaining subject.

  Moreover, you can argue from the fact that an attribute belongs,

or is generally supposed to belong, in a like degree, in three ways,

viz. those described in the last three rules given in regard to a

greater degree.' For supposing that one predicate belongs, or is

supposed to belong, to two subjects in a like degree, then if it

does not belong to the one, neither does it belong to the other; while

if it belongs to the one, it belongs to the remaining one as well. Or,

supposing two predicates to belong in a like degree to the same

subject, then, if the one does not belong, neither does the

remaining one; while if the one does belong, the remaining one belongs

as well. The case is the same also if two predicates belong in a

like degree to two subjects; for if the one predicate does not

belong to the one subject, neither does the remaining predicate belong

to the remaining subject, while if the one predicate does belong to

the one subject, the remaining predicate belongs to the remaining

subject as well.



                                11



  You can argue, then, from greater or less or like degrees of truth

in the aforesaid number of ways. Moreover, you should argue from the

addition of one thing to another. If the addition of one thing to

another makes that other good or white, whereas formerly it was not

white or good, then the thing added will be white or good-it will

possess the character it imparts to the whole as well. Moreover, if an

addition of something to a given object intensifies the character

which it had as given, then the thing added will itself as well be

of that character. Likewise, also, in the case of other attributes.

The rule is not applicable in all cases, but only in those in which

the excess described as an 'increased intensity' is found to take

place. The above rule is, however, not convertible for overthrowing

a view. For if the thing added does not make the other good, it is not

thereby made clear whether in itself it may not be good: for the

addition of good to evil does not necessarily make the whole good, any

more than the addition of white to black makes the whole white.

  Again, any predicate of which we can speak of greater or less

degrees belongs also absolutely: for greater or less degrees of good

or of white will not be attributed to what is not good or white: for a

bad thing will never be said to have a greater or less degree of

goodness than another, but always of badness. This rule is not

convertible, either, for the purpose of overthrowing a predication:

for several predicates of which we cannot speak of a greater degree

belong absolutely: for the term 'man' is not attributed in greater and

less degrees, but a man is a man for all that.

  You should examine in the same way predicates attributed in a

given respect, and at a given time and place: for if the predicate

be possible in some respect, it is possible also absolutely. Likewise,

also, is what is predicated at a given time or place: for what is

absolutely impossible is not possible either in any respect or at

any place or time. An objection may be raised that in a given

respect people may be good by nature, e.g. they may be generous or

temperately inclined, while absolutely they are not good by nature,

because no one is prudent by nature. Likewise, also, it is possible

for a destructible thing to escape destruction at a given time,

whereas it is not possible for it to escape absolutely. In the same

way also it is a good thing at certain places to follow see and such a

diet, e.g. in infected areas, though it is not a good thing

absolutely. Moreover, in certain places it is possible to live

singly and alone, but absolutely it is not possible to exist singly

and alone. In the same way also it is in certain places honourable

to sacrifice one's father, e.g. among the Triballi, whereas,

absolutely, it is not honourable. Or possibly this may indicate a

relativity not to places but to persons: for it is all the same

wherever they may be: for everywhere it will be held honourable

among the Triballi themselves, just because they are Triballi.

Again, at certain times it is a good thing to take medicines, e.g.

when one is ill, but it is not so absolutely. Or possibly this again

may indicate a relativity not to a certain time, but to a certain

state of health: for it is all the same whenever it occurs, if only

one be in that state. A thing is 'absolutely' so which without any

addition you are prepared to say is honourable or the contrary. Thus

(e.g.) you will deny that to sacrifice one's father is honourable:

it is honourable only to certain persons: it is not therefore

honourable absolutely. On the other hand, to honour the gods you

will declare to be honourable without adding anything, because that is

honourable absolutely. So that whatever without any addition is

generally accounted to be honourable or dishonourable or anything else

of that kind, will be said to be so 'absolutely'.
