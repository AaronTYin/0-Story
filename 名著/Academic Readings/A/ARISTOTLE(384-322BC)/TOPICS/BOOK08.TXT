  NEXT there fall to be discussed the problems of arrangement and

method in pitting questions. Any one who intends to frame questions

must, first of all, select the ground from which he should make his

attack; secondly, he must frame them and arrange them one by one to

himself; thirdly and lastly, he must proceed actually to put them to

the other party. Now so far as the selection of his ground is

concerned the problem is one alike for the philosopher and the

dialectician; but how to go on to arrange his points and frame his

questions concerns the dialectician only: for in every problem of that

kind a reference to another party is involved. Not so with the

philosopher, and the man who is investigating by himself: the

premisses of his reasoning, although true and familiar, may be refused

by the answerer because they lie too near the original statement and

so he foresees what will follow if he grants them: but for this the

philosopher does not care. Nay, he may possibly be even anxious to

secure axioms as familiar and as near to the question in hand as

possible: for these are the bases on which scientific reasonings are

built up.

  The sources from which one's commonplace arguments should be drawn

have already been described:' we have now to discuss the arrangement

and formation of questions and first to distinguish the premisses,

other than the necessary premisses, which have to be adopted. By

necessary premisses are meant those through which the actual reasoning

is constructed. Those which are secured other than these are of four

kinds; they serve either inductively to secure the universal premiss

being granted, or to lend weight to the argument, or to conceal the

conclusion, or to render the argument more clear. Beside these there

is no other premiss which need be secured: these are the ones

whereby you should try to multiply and formulate your questions. Those

which are used to conceal the conclusion serve a controversial purpose

only; but inasmuch as an undertaking of this sort is always

conducted against another person, we are obliged to employ them as

well.

  The necessary premisses through which the reasoning is effected,

ought not to be propounded directly in so many words. Rather one

should soar as far aloof from them as possible. Thus if one desires to

secure an admission that the knowledge of contraries is one, one

should ask him to admit it not of contraries, but of opposites: for,

if he grants this, one will then argue that the knowledge of

contraries is also the same, seeing that contraries are opposites;

if he does not, one should secure the admission by induction, by

formulating a proposition to that effect in the case of some

particular pair of contraries. For one must secure the necessary

premisses either by reasoning or by induction, or else partly by one

and partly by the other, although any propositions which are too

obvious to be denied may be formulated in so many words. This is

because the coming conclusion is less easily discerned at the

greater distance and in the process of induction, while at the same

time, even if one cannot reach the required premisses in this way,

it is still open to one to formulate them in so many words. The

premisses, other than these, that were mentioned above, must be

secured with a view to the latter. The way to employ them respectively

is as follows: Induction should proceed from individual cases to the

universal and from the known to the unknown; and the objects of

perception are better known, to most people if not invariably.

Concealment of one's plan is obtained by securing through

prosyllogisms the premisses through which the proof of the original

proposition is going to be constructed-and as many of them as

possible. This is likely to be effected by making syllogisms to

prove not only the necessary premisses but also some of those which

are required to establish them. Moreover, do not state the conclusions

of these premisses but draw them later one after another; for this

is likely to keep the answerer at the greatest possible distance

from the original proposition. Speaking generally, a man who desires

to get information by a concealed method should so put his questions

that when he has put his whole argument and has stated the conclusion,

people still ask 'Well, but why is that?' This result will be

secured best of all by the method above described: for if one states

only the final conclusion, it is unclear how it comes about; for the

answerer does not foresee on what grounds it is based, because the

previous syllogisms have not been made articulate to him: while the

final syllogism, showing the conclusion, is likely to be kept least

articulate if we lay down not the secured propositions on which it

is based, but only the grounds on which we reason to them.

  It is a useful rule, too, not to secure the admissions claimed as

the bases of the syllogisms in their proper order, but alternately

those that conduce to one conclusion and those that conduce to

another; for, if those which go together are set side by side, the

conclusion that will result from them is more obvious in advance.

  One should also, wherever possible, secure the universal premiss

by a definition relating not to the precise terms themselves but to

their co-ordinates; for people deceive themselves, whenever the

definition is taken in regard to a co-ordinate, into thinking that

they are not making the admission universally. An instance would be,

supposing one had to secure the admission that the angry man desires

vengeance on account of an apparent slight, and were to secure this,

that 'anger' is a desire for vengeance on account of an apparent

slight: for, clearly, if this were secured, we should have universally

what we intend. If, on the other hand, people formulate propositions

relating to the actual terms themselves, they often find that the

answerer refuses to grant them because on the actual term itself he is

readier with his objection, e.g. that the 'angry man' does not

desire vengeance, because we become angry with our parents, but we

do not desire vengeance on them. Very likely the objection is not

valid; for upon some people it is vengeance enough to cause them

pain and make them sorry; but still it gives a certain plausibility

and air of reasonableness to the denial of the proposition. In the

case, however, of the definition of 'anger' it is not so easy to

find an objection.

  Moreover, formulate your proposition as though you did so not for

its own sake, but in order to get at something else: for people are

shy of granting what an opponent's case really requires. Speaking

generally, a questioner should leave it as far as possible doubtful

whether he wishes to secure an admission of his proposition or of

its opposite: for if it be uncertain what their opponent's argument

requires, people are more ready to say what they themselves think.

  Moreover, try to secure admissions by means of likeness: for such

admissions are plausible, and the universal involved is less patent;

e.g. make the other person admit that as knowledge and ignorance of

contraries is the same, so too perception of contraries is the same;

or vice versa, that since the perception is the same, so is the

knowledge also. This argument resembles induction, but is not the same

thing; for in induction it is the universal whose admission is secured

from the particulars, whereas in arguments from likeness, what is

secured is not the universal under which all the like cases fall.

  It is a good rule also, occasionally to bring an objection against

oneself: for answerers are put off their guard against those who

appear to be arguing impartially. It is useful too, to add that 'So

and so is generally held or commonly said'; for people are shy of

upsetting the received opinion unless they have some positive

objection to urge: and at the same time they are cautious about

upsetting such things because they themselves too find them useful.

Moreover, do not be insistent, even though you really require the

point: for insistence always arouses the more opposition. Further,

formulate your premiss as though it were a mere illustration: for

people admit the more readily a proposition made to serve some other

purpose, and not required on its own account. Moreover, do not

formulate the very proposition you need to secure, but rather

something from which that necessarily follows: for people are more

willing to admit the latter, because it is not so clear from this what

the result will be, and if the one has been secured, the other has

been secured also. Again, one should put last the point which one most

wishes to have conceded; for people are specially inclined to deny the

first questions put to them, because most people in asking questions

put first the points which they are most eager to secure. On the other

hand, in dealing with some people propositions of this sort should

be put forward first: for ill-tempered men admit most readily what

comes first, unless the conclusion that will result actually stares

them in the face, while at the close of an argument they show their

ill-temper. Likewise also with those who consider themselves smart

at answering: for when they have admitted most of what you want they

finally talk clap-trap to the effect that the conclusion does not

follow from their admissions: yet they say 'Yes' readily, confident in

their own character, and imagining that they cannot suffer any

reverse. Moreover, it is well to expand the argument and insert things

that it does not require at all, as do those who draw false

geometrical figures: for in the multitude of details the whereabouts

of the fallacy is obscured. For this reason also a questioner

sometimes evades observation as he adds in a corner what, if he

formulated it by itself, would not be granted.

  For concealment, then, the rules which should be followed are the

above. Ornament is attained by induction and distinction of things

closely akin. What sort of process induction is obvious: as for

distinction, an instance of the kind of thing meant is the distinction

of one form of knowledge as better than another by being either more

accurate, or concerned with better objects; or the distinction of

sciences into speculative, practical, and productive. For everything

of this kind lends additional ornament to the argument, though there

is no necessity to say them, so far as the conclusion goes.

  For clearness, examples and comparisons should be adduced, and let

the illustrations be relevant and drawn from things that we know, as

in Homer and not as in Choerilus; for then the proposition is likely

to become clearer.



                                 2



  In dialectics, syllogism should be employed in reasoning against

dialecticians rather than against the crowd: induction, on the other

hand, is most useful against the crowd. This point has been treated

previously as well.' In induction, it is possible in some cases to ask

the question in its universal form, but in others this is not easy,

because there is no established general term that covers all the

resemblances: in this case, when people need to secure the

universal, they use the phrase 'in all cases of this sort'. But it

is one of the very hardest things to distinguish which of the things

adduced are 'of this sort', and which are not: and in this connexion

people often throw dust in each others' eyes in their discussion,

the one party asserting the likeness of things that are not alike, and

the other disputing the likeness of things that are. One ought,

therefore, to try oneself to coin a word to cover all things of the

given sort, so as to leave no opportunity either to the answerer to

dispute, and say that the thing advanced does not answer to a like

description, or to the questioner to suggest falsely that it does

answer to a like description, for many things appear to answer to like

descriptions that do not really do so.

  If one has made an induction on the strength of several cases and

yet the answerer refuses to grant the universal proposition, then it

is fair to demand his objection. But until one has oneself stated in

what cases it is so, it is not fair to demand that he shall say in

what cases it is not so: for one should make the induction first,

and then demand the objection. One ought, moreover, to claim that

the objections should not be brought in reference to the actual

subject of the proposition, unless that subject happen to be the one

and only thing of the kind, as for instance two is the one prime

number among the even numbers: for, unless he can say that this

subject is unique of its kind, the objector ought to make his

objection in regard to some other. People sometimes object to a

universal proposition, and bring their objection not in regard to

the thing itself, but in regard to some homonym of it: thus they argue

that a man can very well have a colour or a foot or a hand other

than his own, for a painter may have a colour that is not his own, and

a cook may have a foot that is not his own. To meet them, therefore,

you should draw the distinction before putting your question in such

cases: for so long as the ambiguity remains undetected, so long will

the objection to the proposition be deemed valid. If, however, he

checks the series of questions by an objection in regard not to some

homonym, but to the actual thing asserted, the questioner should

withdraw the point objected to, and form the remainder into a

universal proposition, until he secures what he requires; e.g. in

the case of forgetfulness and having forgotten: for people refuse to

admit that the man who has lost his knowledge of a thing has forgotten

it, because if the thing alters, he has lost knowledge of it, but he

has not forgotten it. Accordingly the thing to do is to withdraw the

part objected to, and assert the remainder, e.g. that if a person have

lost knowledge of a thing while it still remains, he then has

forgotten it. One should similarly treat those who object to the

statement that 'the greater the good, the greater the evil that is its

opposite': for they allege that health, which is a less good thing

than vigour, has a greater evil as its opposite: for disease is a

greater evil than debility. In this case too, therefore, we have to

withdraw the point objected to; for when it has been withdrawn, the

man is more likely to admit the proposition, e.g. that 'the greater

good has the greater evil as its opposite, unless the one good

involves the other as well', as vigour involves health. This should be

done not only when he formulates an objection, but also if, without so

doing, he refuses to admit the point because he foresees something

of the kind: for if the point objected to be withdrawn, he will be

forced to admit the proposition because he cannot foresee in the

rest of it any case where it does not hold true: if he refuse to admit

it, then when asked for an objection he certainly will be unable to

render one. Propositions that are partly false and partly true are

of this type: for in the case of these it is possible by withdrawing a

part to leave the rest true. If, however, you formulate the

proposition on the strength of many cases and he has no objection to

bring, you may claim that he shall admit it: for a premiss is valid in

dialectics which thus holds in several instances and to which no

objection is forthcoming.

  Whenever it is possible to reason to the same conclusion either

through or without a reduction per impossibile, if one is

demonstrating and not arguing dialectically it makes no difference

which method of reasoning be adopted, but in argument with another

reasoning per impossibile should be avoided. For where one has

reasoned without the reduction per impossibile, no dispute can

arise; if, on the other hand, one does reason to an impossible

conclusion, unless its falsehood is too plainly manifest, people

deny that it is impossible, so that the questioners do not get what

they want.

  One should put forward all propositions that hold true of several

cases, and to which either no objection whatever appears or at least

not any on the surface: for when people cannot see any case in which

it is not so, they admit it for true.

  The conclusion should not be put in the form of a question; if it

be, and the man shakes his head, it looks as if the reasoning had

failed. For often, even if it be not put as a question but advanced as

a consequence, people deny it, and then those who do not see that it

follows upon the previous admissions do not realize that those who

deny it have been refuted: when, then, the one man merely asks it as a

question without even saying that it so follows, and the other

denies it, it looks altogether as if the reasoning had failed.

  Not every universal question can form a dialectical proposition as

ordinarily understood, e.g. 'What is man?' or 'How many meanings has

"the good"?' For a dialectical premiss must be of a form to which it

is possible to reply 'Yes' or 'No', whereas to the aforesaid it is not

possible. For this reason questions of this kind are not dialectical

unless the questioner himself draws distinctions or divisions before

expressing them, e.g. 'Good means this, or this, does it not?' For

questions of this sort are easily answered by a Yes or a No. Hence one

should endeavour to formulate propositions of this kind in this

form. It is at the same time also perhaps fair to ask the other man

how many meanings of 'the good' there are, whenever you have

yourself distinguished and formulated them, and he will not admit them

at all.

  Any one who keeps on asking one thing for a long time is a bad

inquirer. For if he does so though the person questioned keeps on

answering the questions, clearly he asks a large number of

questions, or else asks the same question a large number of times:

in the one case he merely babbles, in the other he fails to reason:

for reasoning always consists of a small number of premisses. If, on

the other hand, he does it because the person questioned does not

answer the questions, he is at fault in not taking him to task or

breaking off the discussion.



                                 3



  There are certain hypotheses upon which it is at once difficult to

bring, and easy to stand up to, an argument. Such (e.g.) are those

things which stand first and those which stand last in the order of

nature. For the former require definition, while the latter have to be

arrived at through many steps if one wishes to secure a continuous

proof from first principles, or else all discussion about them wears

the air of mere sophistry: for to prove anything is impossible

unless one begins with the appropriate principles, and connects

inference with inference till the last are reached. Now to define

first principles is just what answerers do not care to do, nor do they

pay any attention if the questioner makes a definition: and yet

until it is clear what it is that is proposed, it is not easy to

discuss it. This sort of thing happens particularly in the case of the

first principles: for while the other propositions are shown through

these, these cannot be shown through anything else: we are obliged

to understand every item of that sort by a definition. The inferences,

too, that lie too close to the first principle are hard to treat in

argument: for it is not possible to bring many arguments in regard

to them, because of the small number of those steps, between the

conclusion and the principle, whereby the succeeding propositions have

to be shown. The hardest, however, of all definitions to treat in

argument are those that employ terms about which, in the first

place, it is uncertain whether they are used in one sense or

several, and, further, whether they are used literally or

metaphorically by the definer. For because of their obscurity, it is

impossible to argue upon such terms; and because of the

impossibility of saying whether this obscurity is due to their being

used metaphorically, it is impossible to refute them.

  In general, it is safe to suppose that, whenever any problem

proves intractable, it either needs definition or else bears either

several senses, or a metaphorical sense, or it is not far removed from

the first principles; or else the reason is that we have yet to

discover in the first place just this-in which of the aforesaid

directions the source of our difficulty lies: when we have made this

clear, then obviously our business must be either to define or to

distinguish, or to supply the intermediate premisses: for it is

through these that the final conclusions are shown.

  It often happens that a difficulty is found in discussing or arguing

a given position because the definition has not been correctly

rendered: e.g. 'Has one thing one contrary or many?': here when the

term 'contraries' has been properly defined, it is easy to bring

people to see whether it is possible for the same thing to have

several contraries or not: in the same way also with other terms

requiring definition. It appears also in mathematics that the

difficulty in using a figure is sometimes due to a defect in

definition; e.g. in proving that the line which cuts the plane

parallel to one side divides similarly both the line which it cuts and

the area; whereas if the definition be given, the fact asserted

becomes immediately clear: for the areas have the same fraction

subtracted from them as have the sides: and this is the definition

of 'the same ratio'. The most primary of the elementary principles are

without exception very easy to show, if the definitions involved, e.g.

the nature of a line or of a circle, be laid down; only the

arguments that can be brought in regard to each of them are not

many, because there are not many intermediate steps. If, on the

other hand, the definition of the starting-points be not laid down, to

show them is difficult and may even prove quite impossible. The case

of the significance of verbal expressions is like that of these

mathematical conceptions.

  One may be sure then, whenever a position is hard to discuss, that

one or other of the aforesaid things has happened to it. Whenever,

on the other hand, it is a harder task to argue to the point

claimed, i.e. the premiss, than to the resulting position, a doubt may

arise whether such claims should be admitted or not: for if a man is

going to refuse to admit it and claim that you shall argue to it as

well, he will be giving the signal for a harder undertaking than was

originally proposed: if, on the other hand, he grants it, he will be

giving the original thesis credence on the strength of what is less

credible than itself. If, then, it is essential not to enhance the

difficulty of the problem, he had better grant it; if, on the other

hand, it be essential to reason through premisses that are better

assured, he had better refuse. In other words, in serious inquiry he

ought not to grant it, unless he be more sure about it than about

the conclusion; whereas in a dialectical exercise he may do so if he

is merely satisfied of its truth. Clearly, then, the circumstances

under which such admissions should be claimed are different for a mere

questioner and for a serious teacher.



                                 4



  As to the formulation, then, and arrangement of one's questions,

about enough has been said.

  With regard to the giving of answers, we must first define what is

the business of a good answerer, as of a good questioner. The business

of the questioner is so to develop the argument as to make the

answerer utter the most extrvagant paradoxes that necessarily follow

because of his position: while that of the answerer is to make it

appear that it is not he who is responsible for the absurdity or

paradox, but only his position: for one may, perhaps, distinguish

between the mistake of taking up a wrong position to start with, and

that of not maintaining it properly, when once taken up.



                                 5



  Inasmuch as no rules are laid down for those who argue for the

sake of training and of examination:-and the aim of those engaged in

teaching or learning is quite different from that of those engaged

in a competition; as is the latter from that of those who discuss

things together in the spirit of inquiry: for a learner should

always state what he thinks: for no one is even trying to teach him

what is false; whereas in a competition the business of the questioner

is to appear by all means to produce an effect upon the other, while

that of the answerer is to appear unaffected by him; on the other

hand, in an assembly of disputants discussing in the spirit not of a

competition but of an examination and inquiry, there are as yet no

articulate rules about what the answerer should aim at, and what

kind of things he should and should not grant for the correct or

incorrect defence of his position:-inasmuch, then, as we have no

tradition bequeathed to us by others, let us try to say something upon

the matter for ourselves.

  The thesis laid down by the answerer before facing the

questioner's argument is bound of necessity to be one that is either

generally accepted or generally rejected or else is neither: and

moreover is so accepted or rejected either absolutely or else with a

restriction, e.g. by some given person, by the speaker or by some

one else. The manner, however, of its acceptance or rejection,

whatever it be, makes no difference: for the right way to answer, i.e.

to admit or to refuse to admit what has been asked, will be the same

in either case. If, then, the statement laid down by the answerer be

generally rejected, the conclusion aimed at by the questioner is bound

to be one generally accepted, whereas if the former be generally

accepted, the latter is generally rejected: for the conclusion which

the questioner tries to draw is always the opposite of the statement

laid down. If, on the other hand, what is laid down is generally

neither rejected nor accepted, the conclusion will be of the same type

as well. Now since a man who reasons correctly demonstrates his

proposed conclusion from premisses that are more generally accepted,

and more familiar, it is clear that (1) where the view laid down by

him is one that generally is absolutely rejected, the answerer ought

not to grant either what is thus absolutely not accepted at all, or

what is accepted indeed, but accepted less generally than the

questioner's conclusion. For if the statement laid down by the

answerer be generally rejected, the conclusion aimed at by the

questioner will be one that is generally accepted, so that the

premisses secured by the questioner should all be views generally

accepted, and more generally accepted than his proposed conclusion, if

the less familiar is to be inferred through the more familiar.

Consequently, if any of the questions put to him be not of this

character, the answerer should not grant them. (2) If, on the other

hand, the statement laid down by the answerer be generally accepted

without qualification, clearly the conclusion sought by the questioner

will be one generally rejected without qualification. Accordingly, the

answerer should admit all views that are generally accepted and, of

those that are not generally accepted, all that are less generally

rejected than the conclusion sought by the questioner. For then he

will probably be thought to have argued sufficiently well. (3)

Likewise, too, if the statement laid down by the answerer be neither

rejected generally nor generally accepted; for then, too, anything

that appears to be true should be granted, and, of the views not

generally accepted, any that are more generally accepted than the

questioner's conclusion; for in that case the result will be that

the arguments will be more generally accepted. If, then, the view laid

down by the answerer be one that is generally accepted or rejected

without qualification, then the views that are accepted absolutely

must be taken as the standard of comparison: whereas if the view

laid down be one that is not generally accepted or rejected, but

only by the answerer, then the standard whereby the latter must

judge what is generally accepted or not, and must grant or refuse to

grant the point asked, is himself. If, again, the answerer be

defending some one else's opinion, then clearly it will be the

latter's judgement to which he must have regard in granting or denying

the various points. This is why those, too, who introduce other's

opinions, e.g. that 'good and evil are the same thing, as Heraclitus

says,' refuse to admit the impossibility of contraries belonging at

the same time to the same thing; not because they do not themselves

believe this, but because on Heraclitus' principles one has to say so.

The same thing is done also by those who take on the defence of one

another's positions; their aim being to speak as would the man who

stated the position.



                                 6



  It is clear, then, what the aims of the answerer should be,

whether the position he lays down be a view generally accepted without

qualification or accepted by some definite person. Now every

question asked is bound to involve some view that is either

generally held or generally rejected or neither, and is also bound

to be either relevant to the argument or irrelevant: if then it be a

view generally accepted and irrelevant, the answerer should grant it

and remark that it is the accepted view: if it be a view not generally

accepted and irrelevant, he should grant it but add a comment that

it is not generally accepted, in order to avoid the appearance of

being a simpleton. If it be relevant and also be generally accepted,

he should admit that it is the view generally accepted but say that it

lies too close to the original proposition, and that if it be

granted the problem proposed collapses. If what is claimed by the

questioner be relevant but too generally rejected, the answerer, while

admitting that if it be granted the conclusion sought follows,

should yet protest that the proposition is too absurd to be

admitted. Suppose, again, it be a view that is neither rejected

generally nor generally accepted, then, if it be irrelevant to the

argument, it may be granted without restriction; if, however, it be

relevant, the answerer should add the comment that, if it be

granted, the original problem collapses. For then the answerer will

not be held to be personally accountable for what happens to him, if

he grants the several points with his eyes open, and also the

questioner will be able to draw his inference, seeing that all the

premisses that are more generally accepted than the conclusion are

granted him. Those who try to draw an inference from premisses more

generally rejected than the conclusion clearly do not reason

correctly: hence, when men ask these things, they ought not to be

granted.



                                 7



  The questioner should be met in a like manner also in the case of

terms used obscurely, i.e. in several senses. For the answerer, if

he does not understand, is always permitted to say 'I do not

understand': he is not compelled to reply 'Yes' or 'No' to a

question which may mean different things. Clearly, then, in the

first place, if what is said be not clear, he ought not to hesitate to

say that he does not understand it; for often people encounter some

difficulty from assenting to questions that are not clearly put. If he

understands the question and yet it covers many senses, then supposing

what it says to be universally true or false, he should give it an

unqualified assent or denial: if, on the other hand, it be partly true

and partly false, he should add a comment that it bears different

senses, and also that in one it is true, in the other false: for if he

leave this distinction till later, it becomes uncertain whether

originally as well he perceived the ambiguity or not. If he does not

foresee the ambiguity, but assents to the question having in view

the one sense of the words, then, if the questioner takes it in the

other sense, he should say, 'That was not what I had in view when I

admitted it; I meant the other sense': for if a term or expression

covers more than one thing, it is easy to disagree. If, however, the

question is both clear and simple, he should answer either 'Yes' or

'No'.



                                 8



  A premiss in reasoning always either is one of the constituent

elements in the reasoning, or else goes to establish one of these:

(and you can always tell when it is secured in order to establish

something else by the fact of a number of similar questions being put:

for as a rule people secure their universal by means either of

induction or of likeness):-accordingly the particular propositions

should all be admitted, if they are true and generally held. On the

other hand, against the universal one should try to bring some

negative instance; for to bring the argument to a standstill without a

negative instance, either real or apparent, shows ill-temper. If,

then, a man refuses to grant the universal when supported by many

instances, although he has no negative instance to show, he

obviously shows ill-temper. If, moreover, he cannot even attempt a

counter-proof that it is not true, far more likely is he to be thought

ill-tempered-although even counter-proof is not enough: for we often

hear arguments that are contrary to common opinions, whose solution is

yet difficult, e.g. the argument of Zeno that it is impossible to move

or to traverse the stadium;-but still, this is no reason for

omitting to assert the opposites of these views. If, then, a man

refuses to admit the proposition without having either a negative

instance or some counter-argument to bring against it, clearly he is

ill-tempered: for ill-temper in argument consists in answering in ways

other than the above, so as to wreck the reasoning.

  Before maintaining either a thesis or a definition the answerer

should try his hand at attacking it by himself; for clearly his

business is to oppose those positions from which questioners

demolish what he has laid down.

  He should beware of maintaining a hypothesis that is generally

rejected: and this it may be in two ways: for it may be one which

results in absurd statements, e.g. suppose any one were to say that

everything is in motion or that nothing is; and also there are all

those which only a bad character would choose, and which are

implicitly opposed to men's wishes, e.g. that pleasure is the good,

and that to do injustice is better than to suffer it. For people

then hate him, supposing him to maintain them not for the sake of

argument but because he really thinks them.

  Of all arguments that reason to a false conclusion the right

solution is to demolish the point on which the fallacy that occurs

depends: for the demolition of any random point is no solution, even

though the point demolished be false. For the argument may contain

many falsehoods, e.g. suppose some one to secure the premisses, 'He

who sits, writes' and 'Socrates is sitting': for from these it follows

that 'Socrates is writing'. Now we may demolish the proposition

'Socrates is sitting', and still be no nearer a solution of the

argument; it may be true that the point claimed is false; but it is

not on that that fallacy of the argument depends: for supposing that

any one should happen to be sitting and not writing, it would be

impossible in such a case to apply the same solution. Accordingly,

it is not this that needs to be demolished, but rather that 'He who

sits, writes': for he who sits does not always write. He, then, who

has demolished the point on which the fallacy depends, has given the

solution of the argument completely. Any one who knows that it is on

such and such a point that the argument depends, knows the solution of

it, just as in the case of a figure falsely drawn. For it is not

enough to object, even if the point demolished be a falsehood, but the

reason of the fallacy should also be proved: for then it would be

clear whether the man makes his objection with his eyes open or not.

  There are four possible ways of preventing a man from working his

argument to a conclusion. It can be done either by demolishing the

point on which the falsehood that comes about depends, or by stating

an objection directed against the questioner: for often when a

solution has not as a matter of fact been brought, yet the

questioner is rendered thereby unable to pursue the argument any

farther. Thirdly, one may object to the questions asked: for it may

happen that what the questioner wants does not follow from the

questions he has asked because he has asked them badly, whereas if

something additional be granted the conclusion comes about. If,

then, the questioner be unable to pursue his argument farther, the

objection would properly be directed against the questioner; if he can

do so, then it would be against his questions. The fourth and worst

kind of objection is that which is directed to the time allowed for

discussion: for some people bring objections of a kind which would

take longer to answer than the length of the discussion in hand.

  There are then, as we said, four ways of making objections: but of

them the first alone is a solution: the others are just hindrances and

stumbling-blocks to prevent the conclusions.



                                11



  Adverse criticism of an argument on its own merits, and of it when

presented in the form of questions, are two different things. For

often the failure to carry through the argument correctly in

discussion is due to the person questioned, because he will not

grant the steps of which a correct argument might have been made

against his position: for it is not in the power of the one side

only to effect properly a result that depends on both alike.

Accordingly it sometimes becomes necessary to attack the speaker and

not his position, when the answerer lies in wait for the points that

are contrary to the questioner and becomes abusive as well: when

people lose their tempers in this way, their argument becomes a

contest, not a discussion. Moreover, since arguments of this kind

are held not for the sake of instruction but for purposes of

practice and examination, clearly one has to reason not only to true

conclusions, but also to false ones, and not always through true

premisses, but sometimes through false as well. For often, when a true

proposition is put forward, the dialectician is compelled to

demolish it: and then false propositions have to be formulated.

Sometimes also when a false proposition is put forward, it has to be

demolished by means of false propositions: for it is possible for a

given man to believe what is not the fact more firmly than the

truth. Accordingly, if the argument be made to depend on something

that he holds, it will be easier to persuade or help him. He, however,

who would rightly convert any one to a different opinion should do

so in a dialectical and not in a contentious manner, just as a

geometrician should reason geometrically, whether his conclusion be

false or true: what kind of syllogisms are dialectical has already

been said. The principle that a man who hinders the common business is

a bad partner, clearly applies to an argument as well; for in

arguments as well there is a common aim in view, except with mere

contestants, for these cannot both reach the same goal; for more

than one cannot possibly win. It makes no difference whether he

effects this as answerer or as questioner: for both he who asks

contentious questions is a bad dialectician, and also he who in

answering fails to grant the obvious answer or to understand the point

of the questioner's inquiry. What has been said, then, makes it

clear that adverse criticism is not to be passed in a like strain upon

the argument on its own merits, and upon the questioner: for it may

very well be that the argument is bad, but that the questioner has

argued with the answerer in the best possible way: for when men lose

their tempers, it may perhaps be impossible to make one's inferences

straight-forwardly as one would wish: we have to do as we can.

  Inasmuch as it is indeterminate when people are claiming the

admission of contrary things, and when they are claiming what

originally they set out to prove-for often when they are talking by

themselves they say contrary things, and admit afterwards what they

have previously denied; for which reason they often assent, when

questioned, to contrary things and to what originally had to be

proved-the argument is sure to become vitiated. The responsibility,

however, for this rests with the answerer, because while refusing to

grant other points, he does grant points of that kind. It is, then,

clear that adverse criticism is not to be passed in a like manner upon

questioners and upon their arguments.

  In itself an argument is liable to five kinds of adverse criticism:

  (1) The first is when neither the proposed conclusion nor indeed any

conclusion at all is drawn from the questions asked, and when most, if

not all, of the premisses on which the conclusion rests are false or

generally rejected, when, moreover, neither any withdrawals nor

additions nor both together can bring the conclusions about.

  (2) The second is, supposing the reasoning, though constructed

from the premisses, and in the manner, described above, were to be

irrelevant to the original position.

  (3) The third is, supposing certain additions would bring an

inference about but yet these additions were to be weaker than those

that were put as questions and less generally held than the

conclusion.

  (4) Again, supposing certain withdrawals could effect the same:

for sometimes people secure more premisses than are necessary, so that

it is not through them that the inference comes about.

  (5) Moreover, suppose the premisses be less generally held and

less credible than the conclusion, or if, though true, they require

more trouble to prove than the proposed view.

  One must not claim that the reasoning to a proposed view shall in

every case equally be a view generally accepted and convincing: for it

is a direct result of the nature of things that some subjects of

inquiry shall be easier and some harder, so that if a man brings

people to accept his point from opinions that are as generally

received as the case admits, he has argued his case correctly.

Clearly, then, not even the argument itself is open to the same

adverse criticism when taken in relation to the proposed conclusion

and when taken by itself. For there is nothing to prevent the argument

being open to reproach in itself, and yet commendable in relation to

the proposed conclusion, or again, vice versa, being commendable in

itself, and yet open to reproach in relation to the proposed

conclusion, whenever there are many propositions both generally held

and also true whereby it could easily be proved. It is possible also

that an argument, even though brought to a conclusion, may sometimes

be worse than one which is not so concluded, whenever the premisses of

the former are silly, while its conclusion is not so; whereas the

latter, though requiring certain additions, requires only such as

are generally held and true, and moreover does not rest as an argument

on these additions. With those which bring about a true conclusion

by means of false premisses, it is not fair to find fault: for a false

conclusion must of necessity always be reached from a false premiss,


but a true conclusion may sometimes be drawn even from false

premisses; as is clear from the Analytics.

  Whenever by the argument stated something is demonstrated, but

that something is other than what is wanted and has no bearing

whatever on the conclusion, then no inference as to the latter can

be drawn from it: and if there appears to be, it will be a sophism,

not a proof. A philosopheme is a demonstrative inference: an

epichireme is a dialectical inference: a sophism is a contentious

inference: an aporeme is an inference that reasons dialectically to

a contradiction.

  If something were to be shown from premisses, both of which are

views generally accepted, but not accepted with like conviction, it

may very well be that the conclusion shown is something held more

strongly than either. If, on the other hand, general opinion be for

the one and neither for nor against the other, or if it be for the one

and against the other, then, if the pro and con be alike in the case

of the premisses, they will be alike for the conclusion also: if, on

the other hand, the one preponderates, the conclusion too will

follow suit.

  It is also a fault in reasoning when a man shows something through a

long chain of steps, when he might employ fewer steps and those

already included in his argument: suppose him to be showing (e.g.)

that one opinion is more properly so called than another, and

suppose him to make his postulates as follows: 'x-in-itself is more

fully x than anything else': 'there genuinely exists an object of

opinion in itself': therefore 'the object-of-opinion-in-itself is more

fully an object of opinion than the particular objects of opinion'.

Now 'a relative term is more fully itself when its correlate is more

fully itself': and 'there exists a genuine opinion-in-itself, which

will be "opinion" in a more accurate sense than the particular

opinions': and it has been postulated both that 'a genuine

opinion-in-itself exists', and that 'x-in-itself is more fully x

than anything else': therefore 'this will be opinion in a more

accurate sense'. Wherein lies the viciousness of the reasoning? Simply

in that it conceals the ground on which the argument depends.



                                12



  An argument is clear in one, and that the most ordinary, sense, if

it be so brought to a conclusion as to make no further questions

necessary: in another sense, and this is the type most usually

advanced, when the propositions secured are such as compel the

conclusion, and the argument is concluded through premisses that are

themselves conclusions: moreover, it is so also if some step is

omitted that generally is firmly accepted.

  An argument is called fallacious in four senses: (1) when it appears

to be brought to a conclusion, and is not really so-what is called

'contentious' reasoning: (2) when it comes to a conclusion but not

to the conclusion proposed-which happens principally in the case of

reductiones ad impossibile: (3) when it comes to the proposed

conclusion but not according to the mode of inquiry appropriate to the

case, as happens when a non-medical argument is taken to be a

medical one, or one which is not geometrical for a geometrical

argument, or one which is not dialectical for dialectical, whether the

result reached be true or false: (4) if the conclusion be reached

through false premisses: of this type the conclusion is sometimes

false, sometimes true: for while a false conclusion is always the

result of false premisses, a true conclusion may be drawn even from

premisses that are not true, as was said above as well.

  Fallacy in argument is due to a mistake of the arguer rather than of

the argument: yet it is not always the fault of the arguer either, but

only when he is not aware of it: for we often accept on its merits

in preference to many true ones an argument which demolishes some true

proposition if it does so from premisses as far as possible

generally accepted. For an argument of that kind does demonstrate

other things that are true: for one of the premisses laid down ought

never to be there at all, and this will then be demonstrated. If,

however, a true conclusion were to be reached through premisses that

are false and utterly childish, the argument is worse than many

arguments that lead to a false conclusion, though an argument which

leads to a false conclusion may also be of this type. Clearly then the

first thing to ask in regard to the argument in itself is, 'Has it a

conclusion?'; the second, 'Is the conclusion true or false?'; the

third, 'Of what kind of premisses does it consist?': for if the

latter, though false, be generally accepted, the argument is

dialectical, whereas if, though true, they be generally rejected, it

is bad: if they be both false and also entirely contrary to general

opinion, clearly it is bad, either altogether or else in relation to

the particular matter in hand.



                                13



  Of the ways in which a questioner may beg the original question

and also beg contraries the true account has been given in the

Analytics:' but an account on the level of general opinion must be

given now.

  People appear to beg their original question in five ways: the first

and most obvious being if any one begs the actual point requiring to

be shown: this is easily detected when put in so many words; but it is

more apt to escape detection in the case of different terms, or a term

and an expression, that mean the same thing. A second way occurs

whenever any one begs universally something which he has to

demonstrate in a particular case: suppose (e.g.) he were trying to

prove that the knowledge of contraries is one and were to claim that

the knowledge of opposites in general is one: for then he is generally

thought to be begging, along with a number of other things, that which

he ought to have shown by itself. A third way is if any one were to

beg in particular cases what he undertakes to show universally: e.g.

if he undertook to show that the knowledge of contraries is always

one, and begged it of certain pairs of contraries: for he also is

generally considered to be begging independently and by itself what,

together with a number of other things, he ought to have shown. Again,

a man begs the question if he begs his conclusion piecemeal: supposing

e.g. that he had to show that medicine is a science of what leads to

health and to disease, and were to claim first the one, then the

other; or, fifthly, if he were to beg the one or the other of a pair

of statements that necessarily involve one other; e.g. if he had to

show that the diagonal is incommensurable with the side, and were to

beg that the side is incommensurable with the diagonal.

  The ways in which people assume contraries are equal in number to

those in which they beg their original question. For it would

happen, firstly, if any one were to beg an opposite affirmation and

negation; secondly, if he were to beg the contrary terms of an

antithesis, e.g. that the same thing is good and evil; thirdly,

suppose any one were to claim something universally and then proceed

to beg its contradictory in some particular case, e.g. if having

secured that the knowledge of contraries is one, he were to claim that

the knowledge of what makes for health or for disease is different;

or, fourthly, suppose him, after postulating the latter view, to try

to secure universally the contradictory statement. Again, fifthly,

suppose a man begs the contrary of the conclusion which necessarily

comes about through the premisses laid down; and this would happen

suppose, even without begging the opposites in so many words, he

were to beg two premisses such that this contradictory statement

that is opposite to the first conclusion will follow from them. The

securing of contraries differs from begging the original question in

this way: in the latter case the mistake lies in regard to the

conclusion; for it is by a glance at the conclusion that we tell

that the original question has been begged: whereas contrary views lie

in the premisses, viz. in a certain relation which they bear to one

another.



                                14



  The best way to secure training and practice in arguments of this

kind is in the first place to get into the habit of converting the

arguments. For in this way we shall be better equipped for dealing

with the proposition stated, and after a few attempts we shall know

several arguments by heart. For by 'conversion' of an argument is

meant the taking the reverse of the conclusion together with the

remaining propositions asked and so demolishing one of those that were

conceded: for it follows necessarily that if the conclusion be untrue,

some one of the premisses is demolished, seeing that, given all the

premisses, the conclusion was bound to follow. Always, in dealing with

any proposition, be on the look-out for a line of argument both pro

and con: and on discovering it at once set about looking for the

solution of it: for in this way you will soon find that you have

trained yourself at the same time in both asking questions and

answering them. If we cannot find any one else to argue with, we

should argue with ourselves. Select, moreover, arguments relating to

the same thesis and range them side by side: for this produces a

plentiful supply of arguments for carrying a point by sheer force, and

in refutation also it is of great service, whenever one is well

stocked with arguments pro and con: for then you find yourself on your

guard against contrary statements to the one you wish to secure.

Moreover, as contributing to knowledge and to philosophic wisdom the

power of discerning and holding in one view the results of either of

two hypotheses is no mean instrument; for it then only remains to make

a right choice of one of them. For a task of this kind a certain

natural ability is required: in fact real natural ability just is

the power right to choose the true and shun the false. Men of

natural ability can do this; for by a right liking or disliking for

whatever is proposed to them they rightly select what is best.

  It is best to know by heart arguments upon those questions which are

of most frequent occurrence, and particularly in regard to those

propositions which are ultimate: for in discussing these answerers

frequently give up in despair. Moreover, get a good stock of

definitions: and have those of familiar and primary ideas at your

fingers' ends: for it is through these that reasonings are effected.

You should try, moreover, to master the heads under which other

arguments mostly tend to fall. For just as in geometry it is useful to

be practised in the elements, and in arithmetic to have the

multiplication table up to ten at one's fingers' ends-and indeed it

makes a great difference in one's knowledge of the multiples of

other numbers too-likewise also in arguments it is a great advantage

to be well up in regard to first principles, and to have a thorough

knowledge of premisses at the tip of one's tongue. For just as in a

person with a trained memory, a memory of things themselves is

immediately caused by the mere mention of their loci, so these

habits too will make a man readier in reasoning, because he has his

premisses classified before his mind's eye, each under its number.

It is better to commit to memory a premiss of general application than

an argument: for it is difficult to be even moderately ready with a

first principle, or hypothesis.

  Moreover, you should get into the habit of turning one argument into

several, and conceal your procedure as darkly as you can: this kind of

effect is best produced by keeping as far as possible away from topics

akin to the subject of the argument. This can be done with arguments

that are entirely universal, e.g. the statement that 'there cannot

be one knowledge of more than one thing': for that is the case with

both relative terms and contraries and co-ordinates.

  Records of discussions should be made in a universal form, even

though one has argued only some particular case: for this will

enable one to turn a single rule into several. A like rule applies

in Rhetoric as well to enthymemes. For yourself, however, you should

as far as possible avoid universalizing your reasonings. You should,

moreover, always examine arguments to see whether they rest on

principles of general application: for all particular arguments really

reason universally, as well, i.e. a particular demonstration always

contains a universal demonstration, because it is impossible to reason

at all without using universals.

  You should display your training in inductive reasoning against a

young man, in deductive against an expert. You should try, moreover,

to secure from those skilled in deduction their premisses, from

inductive reasoners their parallel cases; for this is the thing in

which they are respectively trained. In general, too, from your

exercises in argumentation you should try to carry away either a

syllogism on some subject or a refutation or a proposition or an

objection, or whether some one put his question properly or improperly

(whether it was yourself or some one else) and the point which made it

the one or the other. For this is what gives one ability, and the

whole object of training is to acquire ability, especially in regard

to propositions and objections. For it is the skilled propounder and

objector who is, speaking generally, a dialectician. To formulate a

proposition is to form a number of things into one-for the

conclusion to which the argument leads must be taken generally, as a

single thing-whereas to formulate an objection is to make one thing

into many; for the objector either distinguishes or demolishes, partly

granting, partly denying the statements proposed.

  Do not argue with every one, nor practise upon the man in the

street: for there are some people with whom any argument is bound to

degenerate. For against any one who is ready to try all means in order

to seem not to be beaten, it is indeed fair to try all means of

bringing about one's conclusion: but it is not good form. Wherefore

the best rule is, not lightly to engage with casual acquaintances,

or bad argument is sure to result. For you see how in practising

together people cannot refrain from contentious argument.

  It is best also to have ready-made arguments relating to those

questions in which a very small stock will furnish us with arguments

serviceable on a very large number of occasions. These are those

that are universal, and those in regard to which it is rather

difficult to produce points for ourselves from matters of everyday

experience.
