And the smelly, less-cute baby right
next to me? That's my best friend Lee.

4
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,217
Lee and I were born on the same day,
at the same time,

5
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,868
here in Los Angeles, California.

6
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,747
Our moms were BFFs before people
even used the term "BFF,"

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,349
so we were raised like twins

8
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,126
and we've been pretty much
inseparable ever since.

but for as long as I can remember,

12

Lee and I have absolutely

18

Let me get you up to speed.
First Christmas I remember, I was six.

19
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,549
I got a Barbie dance party.
Lee got a scooter.

20
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,908
Broke my leg riding Lee's scooter.

21
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,637
Had my cast signed by Lee, who bought me
ice cream to make up for breaking my leg.

22
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,474
Dressed as a cowboy for Halloween,
Lee went as a doctor.

23
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,666
Learned how to ride a bike,
learned how to swim.

24
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,687
Got protected by Lee's older brother Noah,

25
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,023
who chased off some bullies
who were hassling us.

26
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,691
Had to pay protection tax, though.

27

Dressed as a fireman for Halloween.

35

Lee went as some weird bird.

36
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,279
Found out that my mom was sick.

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,991
Went to visit her in the hospital
for the first time.

38
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,994
Tried to get used to seeing her there.

39
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,556
Got in a fight with Lee
over who's the best dancer.

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,183
Made up by getting him ice cream.

41
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,310
Got in a fight with Noah
for beating up Lee.

42
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,187
Made up with Noah
by letting him fix my bike.

43
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,688
He is so handy!

44
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,149
Got my first bra. Didn't really need it.

45
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,484
Discovered I like soccer.

46
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,487

Had a tough talk with Dad.

55

Sat with mom in the hospital.

56
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,868
I tried to help her put makeup on.

57
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,744
Not much help.

Tried to score my first kiss

Wasn't exactly a love connection.

63

Watched Noah getting really, really cute!

64
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,363
Watched Noah in yet another fight.
He won.

65

Got my period! Finally!

66
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,117
Went as a pirate for Halloween.

67
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,225
Lee was the Black Swan.

68
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,561
Said goodbye to my mom.

69
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,105
Had a lot to say.

70
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,191
Told her all about Noah.

71
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,170
Watched Noah ride his motorcycle
for the first time.

72
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,547
Watched Lee try to ride Noah's motorcycle.

73
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,282
Watched Noah teach Lee a lesson
for sitting on his motorcycle.

74
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,303
Celebrated with Lee
when he got his dream car.

75
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,680
Learned that girls can be really mean.

76
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,891
Played Seven Minutes in Heaven. Fail!

77

Got a bra I suddenly did need!

78
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,062
Wondered why I still hadn't been
kissed yet or even been on a date.

79
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,564
No big deal, I guess.

80
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,733
Realized I had a crush on Noah.

81
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,300
Got over my crush on Noah...

82

Elle, you are aware that your lady shape
sort of changed over the summer, right?

when you suddenly go from invisible
to everyone staring at you.

198

What the hell, Tuppen?
It's fine, Lee. I got this.

199
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,808
Relax, tiny Flynn.

200
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,435
How about I relax your face?

201

Lee, it's fine! I got this! Lee!

Why did you do that?

00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,710
Lee was in trouble.

217
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,046
Any excuse for a fight, right?

218
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,965
I don't start fights, okay?

219
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,592
I only finish them.

220
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,363
And besides,
no one should treat a girl like that.

221
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,972
Especially if that girl is you.

Me?

223
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,061
Yeah. It's like those guys are trying
to get in my little sister's pants,

224
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,731
which is super gross.

225
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,920
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: Never great to hear your childhood

Whatever!

229
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,453

is asking for it.

234
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,301

with me sounding like a dick.

237
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,170
that skirt is ridiculous.

238
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,089
My pants ripped! It's all I had.
What about your back-ups?

239

Your back-up back-ups?

All right! Don't get so upset!

must punish you.

Lee said that you're gonna give me a ride.

499

Where's your car?

clearly not what's happening here,

get on the damned bike please.

00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:53,804
I am assuming the t-shirt means
you saw me in my underwear?

662
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,663
Yep.
Oh, my God.

663
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,458
Oh, my God! Okay!

664
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,377
Shorts, please!

665
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,671
Can you... please?

666
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:05,924
Noah!

667
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,986
Noah!
All right, fine.

668
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,261
I'll just get it myself!

669
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,700
Stop pulling!
I'm not pulling anything!

670
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,077
Okay, well my arm is caught!
Let me just reach down and...

671
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,662
Oh, my God! I just touched it!

672
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,729
I said stop wiggling!

673
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:23,942
Sorry!

674
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,780
Aren't you forgetting something?

675
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,531
My t-shirt.

676
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,260
Your t-shirt. Right. I'm sorry.
Elle!

677
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,494
What?
Jesus!

678
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:35,930
I was kidding!

679
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,057
So, I should...
Just get out, dork.

680
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,083
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

681
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,628
Never let me drink again.

682
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,632
It's okay. I got it covered.

683
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,569
Made you an emergency survival kit.

684
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:56,391
Some granola, sports drinks, antacids,
and an epic dose of awkward shame!

685
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,976
Thank you.

686
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,605
Oh, and... really good work last night.

687
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,607
What do you mean?

688
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,878
You told everybody that Noah and the OMGs

689
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,570
would be doing the kissing booth.

690
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,616
Come on!

691
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,121
And even though I felt
like I was about to puke my liver out,

692
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,707
I couldn't stop thinking about Noah.

693
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,875
Our accidental groping.

694
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,480
It seemed like he just saw me
as a little sister,

695
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:31,175
but I couldn't help wondering if he had
a different reason for protecting me.

696
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,696
Listen, it's all about the OMGs.

697
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,906
We get them to do the booth,
everyone else will follow.

698
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,058
Do you want to go over the plan again?
No, I think I got it.

699
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,269
Okay, wish me luck!
Good luck.

700
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,437
Okay!

701
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,567

It's "Elle," actually. No "N."

705
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,459
Why are you standing and talking
instead of sitting and talking?

706
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,087
Oh, yeah, okay.

707
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,468
Ask Mia about me!

708

Lee wants to know if you like him.
Flynn's brother?

709
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,481
Yeah, he's cute.
Needs to learn to dress, though.

710
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,400
But more importantly,

711
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,403
everything's set
for the kissing booth, right?

712
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,032
Okay, so here's what I just heard.

713
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,220
Flynn likes one of you. Yeah.

714
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,850
And rumor has it that if the person
he likes is working the booth,

715
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,125
then he'll be there, too.

so we need to move. Chop-chop!

Have I ever told you that you're bossy?

735
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,673
Yes, but then I told you
not to tell me that anymore.

Ha-ha-ha. You're funny.
I prefer the term "witty."

The only reason I ever talked to that dork

was to make sure he'd get his brother
to come to the booth tonight.

00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,565

Hey.
Hey.

988
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,872
Why didn't Lee give you
a ride home tonight?

989
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:48,874
Um...

990
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,458
He just got busy.

I couldn't stop thinking
about what Noah said to me.

996
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,104

1068

No more fighting.

1069
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,253
Done.

1070
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:29,547

1074
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,684
If we do this, nobody can know.

1075
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,686

01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,203
Why, is it from a boy?

1154
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:17,955
Yeah, right.

1155
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,708

on your phone?

1156
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,003

Oh.
Yeah.

1185
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,822

Yeah, we really haven't been
hanging out much, right?

1211
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,204
You've been, like,
acting really weird recently.

1212
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:47,790
Wait.

1213
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,936
Is this because
you don't have a date to prom?

1214
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,647
Because if that's it,
you can come with Rachel and I.

1215
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:54,505

Absolutely! The more, the merrier!

1224
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,405
So, what was it you were saying?

1225

Oh, nothing.

1226
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,035
It was about prom. So...

1227
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,706
Okay. Off. My turn.
<font color="#ff8000">LEE</font>: Bully!

1228

It's so her!

1231
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,798
Hey, could you pass me the wrench, please?

1232
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,236
The little black tool box
on top of the shelf.

1233

Thank you.
You're welcome.

1234

Elle!

1235
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,610
When'd you become such a doctor?

1236
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,671
Since I started getting into fights.

1237
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,823
You kind of learn to take care of yourself
when that happens.

1238
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,285
Why do you get in all those fights anyway?

1239
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:09,747
I think I...

1240
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:13,918
I guess it's kind of just how I'm wired.

1241
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,837
I don't believe that.

1242
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,716
My parents even sent me to see
a couple of counselors.

1243
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:25,221
But you know, we're all fucked up
one way or another, right?

1244
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,182
You could change.

1245
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,977
You think I can change?

1246
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:33,896
You're Noah Flynn.

1247
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,359

01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,417
Oh, I had an accident
and Noah offered to help.

1253
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:00,440
Did you do that to her?
What did you just say?

1254
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,692
I said did you do that to her?
Did you hit Elle?

1255
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:05,153
You really think I'd hit her?
I wouldn't put it past you.

1256
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,489
Hey, no. Lee, I'm fine.

1257
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,366
I just tripped in the garage.

1258
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,766
I was looking for you.

1259
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,874
You really expect me to believe
that she just tripped?

1260
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:20,335
Get a clue, Lee! You weren't even here!
I swear to God,

1261
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,004
if you laid a hand on her...
All right, that's it!

1262
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:25,197
Noah! Hey! Stop! Noah! Stop!

1263
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,784
Look at me. Noah, look at me!

1264
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:34,498
Come on.

1265
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,797
Is there something going on
between you two?

1266
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:44,216
What?

1267
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,844
No, nothing is going on.

1268
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,139
Okay.

1269
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,515
Fine.

1270
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,744
But I really need to get out of here.

1271
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,788
Do you want to go downstairs
and start the car?

1272
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,314
I just need to grab my things.

1273
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,028
Look, I have to tell him tonight.

1274
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,280
Yeah.

1275
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,698
It's time.

1276
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,951
That way I can take you to prom.

1277
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,376
What the fuck?

1278
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:21,837
Lee, I can explain.

1279
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,481
Unbelievable.

1280
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,150
Wait, no. Lee. Lee, wait.

1281
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,902
Wait, Noah. Stay here, please.

1282
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,136
Let me handle this.

1283
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,242
Lee!

1284
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,267
Lee, wait!

1285
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,728
Lee, wait! Wait.

1286
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,108
So this is what you've been
keeping from me?

1287
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,962
You were never meant to find out this way.

1288
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:48,214
Seems I was never meant to find out
at all, doesn't it?

1289
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,675
Hey, lay off her, Lee.
It's not like it's all Elle's fault.

1290
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,677
You! Don't even get me started
on you, okay?

1291
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,430
Telling other guys to stay away from Elle
to protect her.

1292
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,457
And there you are, treating her like
some slut that you picked up at the club.

1293
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:01,418
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

1294
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:05,005
So you're trying to tell me
that you two have not slept together.

1295
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,057
I knew it.

1296
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:19,079
So you really just have been fucking
my brother and lying to me.

1297
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,122
No.
Okay, Lee. That is enough.

1298
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:24,334
No, it's not enough. She has no clue
what she's gotten herself into with you!

1299
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,069
This is bullshit.
You're acting like a hurt, little bitch.

1300
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,926
Noah, get off of him!
Stop!

1301
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,511
Noah, get off of him!
Calm down!

1302
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:38,098
That is enough! Calm down! I'm not
letting you go until you chill out!

1303
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,808
Get off of me!
Chill out!

1304
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,477
Get off!
Get off him! Get off!

1305
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,603
Please!

1306
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:44,586
Stop!

1307
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:57,766
Here.

1308
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:05,941
Please.

1309
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,862
Please, Lee!

1310
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,865
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: Stop, Lee! Please!

1311
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,741
Lee, please!

1312
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:18,036
Please, Lee, don't leave like this.

1313
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,247
So much for Rule Number Nine, huh?

1314
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,458
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1315
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,505
You know, my whole life,

1316
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,261
Noah has gotten everything
that he has ever wanted.

1317
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:41,018
The only thing that I had
that he didn't...

1318
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,270
was you.

1319
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,776
And now he has that too.

1320
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:51,987
Lee.

1321
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,406
It's okay.

1322
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,868
You two deserve each other.

1323
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,210
Elle.

1324
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,213
Look, it's okay. He'll get over it.

1325
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:14,027
Why? Why did you come downstairs?

1326
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,196
I told you to stay inside!

1327
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,263
Like you wanted to make things worse!

1328
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,975
What is wrong with you?

1329
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:25,562
You can not pin all this on me.

1330
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,943
Just leave me alone.

1331
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,238
No problem.

1332
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,953
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: Some people say you'll fall in love.

1333
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,580
And that's the person
you'll spend forever with.

1334
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:49,169
They'll be the one who, no matter what,
you can't live without.

1335
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,005
But at that moment

1336
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,091
all I cared about was Lee.

1337
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,553
And I was pretty sure
I'd lost him forever.

Hey.

1340
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:10,023
Hey.

1341
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:15,195
There's someone here to see you.

1342
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:16,613
Lee?

1343
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,493
Hi, Elle.

1344
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,456
I was hoping maybe we could talk.

1345
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:36,758
There's really nothing to talk about.

1346
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:41,179
I'm just really sorry for lying to Lee
about Noah and...

1347
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,891
Now I've ruined our friendship.

1348
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:50,105
Elle, I was friends with your mom
for over 20 years.

1349
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,483
She was my best, best friend.

1350
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:56,570
But if you think
that we didn't fight sometimes,

1351
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,447
you got another thing coming.

1352
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:00,174
Really?

1353
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,158
Sure.

1354
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:06,705
But you know, I can't really remember
what a single fight was really about.

1355
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,374
But what I do remember

1356
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,628
is that we always forgave each other.

1357
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,048
It doesn't really feel like that
right now.

1358
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:17,758
Don't give up on him.

1359
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:23,597
You're lucky if you can get even one
really good best friend in your life.

1360
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,310
You just have to figure out
how to make it right.

1361
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,861
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: I gotta admit, the next couple
of weeks were pretty lonely.

1362
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,091
Noah was totally MIA.

1363
01:17:42,115 --> 01:17:44,552
His attendance at school got so bad,

1364
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,495
he was in danger of not graduating.

1365
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,307
Worst of all,

1366
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,334
<font color="#ff00ff">(PHONE RINGING)</font>
Lee was completely ignoring me.

1367
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:57,214
At least Dad had forgiven me.
He even paid for my driving lessons.

1368
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:00,342
Decided it was about time
I got my license.

1369
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,930
Then one day it hit me.

1370
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,102
Holy crap! Rule Number Seven!

1371
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:14,064
No matter how mad you are
at your best friend,

1372
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:17,067
you have to forgive them
if they give you ice cream.

1373
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,278
I'm sorry.

1374
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:48,557
<font color="#ff8000">NOAH</font>: Hey, Mr. Evans.

1375

Where have you been, Noah?

1376
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:01,820
I had to get away and think.

1377
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,196
I'm...

1378
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:05,174
I'm on my way home now.

1379
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:06,032
Good.

1380
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:08,702
Listen, Elle's not here.

1381
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:12,247
I'm actually here to talk to you.

1382
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,083
Oh?

1383
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,252
I just...

1384
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,921
I wanted to apologize.

1385
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,007
About everything.

1386
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,301
I shouldn't have let it happen.

1387
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,052
It was all my fault.

1388
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:27,763
Not Elle's.

1389
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,660
But I'm not sorry that it did happen.

1390
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:35,061
Or for the way that I feel
about your daughter.

1391
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:38,899
Oh, Noah.

1392
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,528
I can't say I support the two of you.
I can't.

1393
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,573
But it's got to be Elle's choice.

1394
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:51,077
I just think that Elle is gonna have
to figure out what's best for Elle.

1395
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:54,372
I understand.

Hello, Los Angeles Country Day Prom!

1447
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:43,995
Now, I'd like to introduce
this year's theme...

1448
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,371
Memories.

1449
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,559
Photographs which show
images of great moments

1450
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,086
from a truly fantastic year.

1451
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,564
The moments that stood out

1452
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:56,591
and helped to define
who we are as a class.

1453
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,803
It's a final look back on who we were,

1454
01:25:00,553 --> 01:25:05,141
at the very moment that we're looking
forward to who we want to become.

This is so cool!

1466
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,141
Who did this? It's beautiful!

1473
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:08,997
I don't know.

1486
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,996
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: It was at this exact moment
that I finally felt okay.

1487
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,248
I wasn't thinking about Noah,

1488
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:54,667
or Lee, or anybody.

1489
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:57,337
I was a small part of something
that mattered.

1490
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:00,006
The kissing booth
meant something to people.

1491
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,592
It was gonna be remembered by everybody.

1492
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:05,637
And that made me happy.

1493
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:08,699
Until I saw him.

1494
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:13,287

<i><font color="#ffff00">♪</font> Forget about me... <font color="#ffff00">♪</font></i>

1498
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:19,501

1501
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:29,535
I'm sorry, Noah.

1502
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:31,913
I can't.

1503
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,082
No, Elle, wait, please!

1504
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,375
Elle.

1505
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,795
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪</font> When you walk away... <font color="#ffff00">♪</font></i>

1506
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:41,839
Why?

1507
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:44,676
Why should I?

1508
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:48,179
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪</font> Oh will you walk away... <font color="#ffff00">♪</font></i>

1509
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:49,847
Because I love you.

1510
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:55,395
And standing here,

1511
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:58,314
in front of everyone,

1512
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,149
I'm telling you

1513
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,402
that I love you.

1514
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:09,909
I'm sorry.

1515
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:11,828
I just...

1516
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:16,332
I can't keep hurting people
that I care about because of you.

1517
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,335
Okay? Nobody wants us to be together.

1518
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:23,131
Well, that may be true.

1519
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,260
But what do you want?

1520
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:30,638
I want...

1521
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:42,459
I want to go.

1522
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,443
Elle.

1523
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,927
Hey, Elle! Wait up!

1524
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,515
Hey.

1525
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,395
Hey.

1526
01:30:05,358 --> 01:30:06,192
Listen.

1527
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:10,947
I just came to say I'm sorry about
what happened on the lawn the other day.

1528
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:13,533
And for everything with Elle.

1529
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,828
I never should have been lying to you.

1530
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,372
But I wanted you to know that...

1531
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:21,666
I was never playing Elle.

1532
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,545
And I meant everything
that I said to her tonight.

1533
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:32,343
And not that you care,

1534
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:36,472
but I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.

1535
01:30:38,474 --> 01:30:41,978
I figured I'd try to get settled in
before the fall term. You know?

1536
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:47,525
All right.

1537
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,486
Well, I'll see you around, eh?

1538
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:54,365
Oh, and...

1539
01:30:58,619 --> 01:30:59,912
Happy birthday, man.

1540
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:09,964
<font color="#ff8000">LEE</font>: Rachel's getting here in ten minutes.

1541
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:12,467
Is Noah gonna be here tonight?

1542
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:16,053
He told me last night
he was leaving for Harvard today.

1543
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,349
He just didn't want to be around here.

1544
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,102
But hey, it's for the best.

1545
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,480
I mean, I think you did the right thing.

1546
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:28,441
Don't you?

1547
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:32,111
Yeah.

1548
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:44,349
So, what'd you wish for?

1549
01:31:44,373 --> 01:31:46,083
No, you know the rules.

1550
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:47,752
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: Rule Number One...

1551
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,797
Only your best friend
gets to know your birthday wishes.

1552
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:54,383
So, how about you?

1553
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,260
No wish this year.

1554
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:00,181
Okay.

1555
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:41,681
Hey!

1556
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:43,683
Where you going?

1557
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:46,537
I can't keep doing this.

1558
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,562
Doing what?

1559
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:55,945
Elle, what's wrong?

1560
01:32:57,488 --> 01:32:58,322
Hey!

1561
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,283
You're acting all weird.

1562
01:33:05,204 --> 01:33:06,455
I love you.

1563
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,293
And I always, always

1564
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,169
want to be close to you.

1565
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:16,465
But being my best friend

1566
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:20,845
doesn't give you the right
to tell me who I can love.

1567
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:22,680
It's like with Rachel.

1568
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:26,601
What if I didn't like having her around?
What would you do then?

1569
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,580
I guess I'd break up with her.
No, you see?

1570
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:33,458
You shouldn't have to do that just
because I didn't want you to be with her.

1571
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:34,626
No. Come on, Elle.

1572
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:36,920
This isn't the same thing as with Noah
and you know that.

1573
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:38,613
Okay. Listen to me, Lee.

1574
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:42,366
We made up our rules when we were six.

1575
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:44,577
What are you saying?

1576
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:49,915
I'm saying that I love Noah.

1577
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,751
And I want him.

1578
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,730
And I'm sorry if that hurts you,

1579
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:57,798
and I'm so sorry
that I lied to you before.

1580
01:33:58,633 --> 01:33:59,592
I was wrong.

1581
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:04,323
But I'd be lying to you again
if I didn't tell you that I love him

1582
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,682
with every bit of my heart.

1583
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:10,394
And if you just can't accept that,

1584
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:13,606
then...

1585
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,072
Then maybe you can't be part of my life.

1586
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:32,083
I think you're making a big mistake.

1587
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,212
Then that's my decision to make.

1588
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:41,467
<font color="#ff8000">LEE</font>: You're right.

1589
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,930
I love you, Elle,
and I just want you to be happy.

1590
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:47,640
Thank you!

1591
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:53,229
Okay.

1592
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:56,083
I have to find him. Like now.

1593
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,918
It's okay. I'll help you find him, okay?

1594
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:00,712
Okay, let me go just make sure
my dad knows where I'm going, okay?

1595
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:02,964
Meet you outside in five,
and you can drive the Stang.

1596
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:05,241
Thank you. I love you so much! Thank you!
Go!

1597
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,203
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: Here we go!

1598
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:12,474
Thank you for doing this, by the way.

1599
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:13,499
<font color="#ff8000">LEE</font>: No problem.

1600
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,418
You know,

1601
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:19,773
I think the hardest part
was just seeing Noah's face at prom.

1602
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:21,757
Gosh, I wish I had just told him then.

1603
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:23,843
But you know what? No matter

1604
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:27,847
how he feels now, I've just gotta find him
and tell him how I feel.

1605
01:35:29,348 --> 01:35:30,182
You just did.

1606
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:34,437
Oh, my God!

1607
01:35:35,354 --> 01:35:38,291
Oh, my God!
Oh, Jesus, woman! Pull over!

1608
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:40,210
Pull over! Pull the car over!

1609
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:42,653
My God! You're trying to kill us!
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: Oh, my God!

1610
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:45,156
I was not expecting that!

1611
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,658
Oh, my God! Like, what?

1612
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:50,494
Hi!

1613
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,955
I thought you were leaving
for Harvard.

1614
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:56,751
Yeah, I was planning to, but...

1615
01:35:58,627 --> 01:36:01,380
I decided I had to see you
one last time before I went.

1616
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:03,632
Noah.

1617
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:08,262
And then Lee came upstairs
and he told me everything.

1618
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:10,723
And the old switcheroo was his idea?

1619
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,827
It was like a classic Lee, huh?
Yeah!

1620
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:16,479
He said something
about Rule Number 18 or whatever.

1621
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,689
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: Rule Number 18...

1622
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:22,485
Always be happy
for your bestie's successes.

1623
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:25,488
Yeah. Classic Lee.

1624
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:29,468
Thanks for staying a little longer.

1625
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:32,369
Well, I had to see you blow out
the candles on your cake.

1626
01:36:33,078 --> 01:36:35,122
Happy birthday to me.

1627
01:36:39,668 --> 01:36:41,045
So, what about Harvard?

1628
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,255
I don't want to talk about that right now.

1629
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:50,346
You know, I want to know what it was
that you wanted to tell me.

1630
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:52,681
<font color="#ff00ff">(EXHALES)</font>

1631
01:36:52,848 --> 01:36:54,266
Um...

1632
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:02,608
Sitting here in front of...

1633
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:06,237
no one in particular,

1634
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,118
I'm saying I love you.

1635
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:17,414
And I love you.

1636
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:36,392
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: The next few weeks
before Noah left for school

1637
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,936
we spent every spare minute together...

1638
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:42,106
up to the very last second.

1639
01:37:48,445 --> 01:37:49,280
Goodbye.

1640
01:37:49,905 --> 01:37:51,967
Come on, Shelly. Don't say it like that.

1641
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:54,076
I'll see you soon,
and you can come and visit.

1642
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:57,037
And we can make this work.
Okay, stop.

1643
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,873
Don't say anything.

1644
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,126
I just want to be with you
for a few seconds more.

1645
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,712
You are cute when you're being bossy!

1646
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:09,717
And don't turn back for a final wave.

1647
01:38:10,509 --> 01:38:12,761
That is way too cheesy and romantic.

1648
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:14,513
Even for me.

1649
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:31,739
Okay.

1650
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:45,836
See you.

1651
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,142
<font color="#ff8000">ELLE</font>: Maybe things really
would work out with Noah.

1652
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,646
I hoped they would.

1653
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:14,239
But maybe they wouldn't.

1654
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,413
And no matter how much I wanted it,

1655
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:25,584
things couldn't stay
the way they were forever.

1656
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:27,962
But whatever happened,

1657
01:39:28,671 --> 01:39:30,398
I knew there was a part of me

1658
01:39:30,422 --> 01:39:32,925
that was always
going to belong to Noah Flynn.

1659
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,053
A little piece of my heart

1660
01:39:36,595 --> 01:39:38,681
that would always be Noah's.

1661
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,350
And for the first time,

1662
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:46,271
everything suddenly seemed...

1663
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:48,399
possible.

1664
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:54,655
But it's funny when I think about it.

1665
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:58,659
Because all this happened

1666
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:01,996
just because of a kissing booth.

1667
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,661
Nine gold diggers, take two.

1668
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,228
Common... A and B common mark.

1669
01:40:28,313 --> 01:40:29,148
Mark.

1671
01:40:34,778 --> 01:40:36,297
No.
How could that happen?

1672
01:40:36,321 --> 01:40:37,281
Hell no!

Hey.
Hey.

1677
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:54,858
Check it out.

1678
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:56,943
Do it.
Oh, my...

1680
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,388
Yeah!

1681
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,284
I'll make out with you.

1682
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:07,895
So... sweet of you. I'm okay, though.
Thank you.

Look! You're blushing! How cute!

1688
01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:30,935
First of all, if you mention this
to anyone, and I mean anyone...

1689
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:32,336
Kissing booth.
What?

1690
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:35,315
I save you, and now you're trying
to blackmail me.

1691
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:37,400
Oh, come on.

1692
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:40,361
Sounds so tawdry when you put it that way,
but yes, definitely.

01:41:40,385 --> 01:41:42,054
Out!
Okay. I'm going.

Do you think you could maybe
get a ride home with somebody else?

I think she might even let me
play with her boobies later.

You're picking boobies
over my awesomeness?

Boobies. My answer
